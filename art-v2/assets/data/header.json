    "data":"<p class='first-par'>The <a href='/'>Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART)</a> is a step-by-step guide to help you easily identify relevant accessibility requirements from the <a href='https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines'>Revised 508 Standards</a>, and incorporate them into your procurement and contracting documentation, as well as in-house IT development. GSA’s IT Accessibility Program developed ART as part of its mission to provide technical assistance to federal agencies, to improve compliance with <a href='https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/'>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a>. Use ART to buy and build technology that’s accessible to all.</p>"
