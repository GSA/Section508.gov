### Other Tips

  * When generating PDF documents through conversion from another format, or through an automated tool, ensure the resulting PDF file is properly tagged to support accessibility.  
  * If using an authoring tool, make sure the tool is capable of generating accessible PDF documents that conform to PDF/UA (some do not). PDF/UA provides a standardized framework for software to create, test and remediate accessible PDFs. PDF/UA and WCAG should be complimentary. See also [PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0][14].
