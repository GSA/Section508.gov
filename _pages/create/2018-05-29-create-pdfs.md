### Other Tips

  * When generating PDF documents through conversion from another format, or through an automated tool, ensure the resulting PDF file is properly tagged to support accessibility.
  * If using an authoring tool, make sure the tool is capable of generating accessible PDF documents that conform to PDF/UA (some do not).
