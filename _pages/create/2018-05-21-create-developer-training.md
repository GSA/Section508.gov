From general training to certification programs, there are many training options to help you improve your accessibility skills. Learn how to build digital tools that conform to the  [Revised 508 Standards][1].

## General Training

Visit the [Training page][2] for general training on Section 508 and IT Accessibility.

### Certifications

The [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)][3] offers two accessibility certifications:

  * [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competency (CPACC)][4]
  * [Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)][5]

Visit IAAP's [Prepare][6] page for more information about how to prepare for the various IAAP certifications.

If you complete both certifications above, you’ll also receive a Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA) designation.

### Education Initiatives

  * [Teach Access][10] - Aims to expand the quality and quantity of undergraduate programs that teach accessibility fundamentals in fields such as design, computer science, and human computer interaction
  * [Teach Access Tutorial][11] - learn about mobile app and website accessibility

## Web Accessibility Training

These resources (including some no-cost offerings) can help you understand how accessibility is achieved in certain specialized environments. You must understand your development environment to determine what, specifically, you’ll need to know.

### Original 508 Standards

A number of organizations offer training based on the Original 508 Standards. Though the Standards have been revised, many are still valuable, including:

  * [Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Tester Certification][12]
  * Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) Best Practices Library

### Web Accessibility

More modern resources include:

  * Rob Dodson from Google has a [great introductory talk][13]
  * Google’s [Udacity course on Web Accessibility][14] introduces tools and techniques for web developers to easily ensure that websites are more accessible
  * [Web Accessibility Udacity][15] offers hands-on experience to make web applications accessible
  * [The Code4Lib Journal][16] – A Practical Guide on Developing Accessible Websites
  * [Making Microsoft Office Documents Accessible][17]
