### Other Video Tips
* Ensure video content includes synchronized captions.
  * Carefully review and edit the accuracy and synchronized timing of the captions, even if captions are provided through automated captioning software.
* Ensure audio descriptions for people with visual disabilities are included in the default sound track, or as a separate selectable sound track.
* If you are providing a multimedia player to view electronic content, make sure the player addresses the software provisions in the standards.
* If you are providing a learning management system tool to help users locate and track usage of the content, make sure that:
  * The system addresses the software requirements; and
  * The electronic content provided through the system meets the electronic document provisions.
