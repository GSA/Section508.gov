## 2022 Interagency Accessibility Forum

The 2022 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) celebrated accessibility as a foundation for information technology within the federal government.

Attendees of this ninth annual IAAF heard two keynote addresses, along with presentations and panel discussions that focused on ***Unlocking the Power of Accessibility***. In addition, the forum – for the first time – included virtual workshops hosted by accessibility subject matter experts who work within their agency to ensure equivalent access to information and digital services by people living with disabilities.

Whether you were new to IT accessibility or a seasoned content creator, there was something for everyone – acquisition officials, business analysts, project managers, developers, testers, content creators, Section 508 Program Managers, agency management and leadership, and federal personnel and contractors interested in accessibility.

The 2022 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) was sponsored by the Federal Chief Information Officer Council’s (Federal CIO Council) Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) and hosted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program from the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) of the General Services Administration (GSA), and National Institutes of Health, in partnership with other federal agencies.
