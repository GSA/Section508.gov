Federal agencies have a simple, cost-effective way to provide foundational accessibility training to their entire workforce. The Government-wide IT Accessibility Program in the General Services Administration (GSA), provides a no-cost solution to support Section 508 awareness and compliance through a reusable, government-branded e-learning course.

## **Ready-to-Use Section 508 Training Packages**

The Section 508 courses are designed to help federal employees, executives, and acquisition professionals understand the importance of accessible information and communication technology (ICT), the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and their role in meeting those obligations.

Through a memorandum of understanding (MOU), GSA makes the course files available at no cost to other federal agencies, eliminating the time and expense associated with developing in-house training. The courses can be hosted on an agency’s Learning Management System (LMS) and assigned as mandatory or optional training based on agency policy.

## **Why Agencies Are Adopting It**

Several federal agencies have already adopted these courses—or their own equivalent—as required annual training for all staff. Making accessibility training a standard part of onboarding and recurring learning cycles helps reinforce the importance of ICT accessibility, prevent noncompliance, and reduce the need for costly remediation of inaccessible content.

With centralized development and periodic updates managed by GSA, agencies can be confident that course content reflects the latest federal guidance and best practices in ICT accessibility. GSA also provides the courses in multiple Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) versions, depending on the SCORM version most compatible with an agency’s LMS.

## **What’s Included**

Agencies that enter into the MOU receive:

* SCORM-compliant course files for LMS deployment (available in v1.2 and 2004 3rd Edition)

* Course description and metadata

* Access to future updates

## **How to Get Started**

For more information or to request access to the course materials, contact **Section.508@gsa.gov** or visit the [Online Training Courses]({{site.baseurl}}/training-home/#online-training-courses) page on Section508.gov.
