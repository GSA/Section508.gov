## What is the ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio?

The [ICT Testing Baselines](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/) (aka, the Baselines) provide a standardized set of test procedure components for evaluating Section 508 conformance. Incorporating the Baseline tests into a testing process ensures that necessary elements of information and communications technology (ICT) are tested, reducing the risk of overlooking important requirements and ensuring comprehensive ICT accessibility test results. The Baselines provide clear guidance on what needs to be tested, helping organizations assess the accuracy of their testing methodology and tools.

The ICT Testing Baseline is:

<ol class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
  <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
      <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-green"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#check_circle"></use></svg></div>
      <div class="usa-icon-list__content">A comprehensive set of test procedure components that a Section 508 conformance testing process should include to ensure full coverage of all requirements.</div>
  </li>  
  <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
      <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-green"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#check_circle"></use></svg></div>
      <div class="usa-icon-list__content">Testing tools agnostic.</div>
  </li>  
</ol>


The ICT Testing Baseline is not:

* A step-by-step testing procedure or methodology.  
* A specific testing tool or software for Section 508 conformance testing.

The Portfolio includes a [Baseline for Web](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/web-baselines/) and a [Baseline for Documents](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/document-baselines/). Additional Baselines will be developed for all ICT covered by Section 508 including software and hardware.

## How to Contribute 

If you are a federal employee or provide direct contract support to a federal agency, we invite you to contribute directly as a member of our ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio Working Group. Even if you are not a federal employee or contractor, we still welcome your feedback and contributions via submission of [issues](https://github.com/Section508Coordinators/baselinealignment/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Section508Coordinators/baselinealignment/pulls) in the [ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio GitHub repository](https://github.com/atbcb/ICTTestingBaseline). We are also happy to accept your input and recommendations for other methods of contributions via [ictbaseline@gsa.gov](mailto:ictbaseline@gsa.gov).

Contributors do not need to be highly technical nor make a long-term commitment, although both skills and time can certainly be helpful. 

The ICT Testing Baseline Working Group needs help refining [ICT Testing Baselines](https://ictbaseline.access-board.gov/). Below are the current Baseline Working Groups:

* Baseline for Electronic Documents  
* Baseline for Hardware  
* Baseline for Software  
* Baseline for Web

The ICT Baseline Alignment for Web Working Group also needs help developing and evaluating web test cases. You can submit web test cases to help validate test processes and tools as [pull requests](https://github.com/Section508Coordinators/baselinealignment/pulls) in the [ICT Testing Baseline Portfolio GitHub repository](https://github.com/atbcb/ICTTestingBaseline). Current web test cases can be viewed at [ICT Testing Baseline Alignment Framework](https://baselinealignment.section508.gov/) along with more information on contributing.
