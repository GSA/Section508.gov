title: 'Accessibility Testing for Websites and Software'

Web designers, developers, and content managers play a key role in ensuring websites and digital tools are accessible, and conform to the [Revised 508 Standards][1] and the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)][2] 2.0 Level AA.

## Trusted Tester Program

The Interagency Trusted Tester Program promotes a unified, consistent, shareable, and repeatable test and evaluation approach for Section 508 standards conformance. The goal is to reduce redundant testing and save agencies money.

  * [Interagency Trusted Tester Program][3]

## Testing Tools for Web

The tools used in the Trusted Tester Test Process (and [ICT Testing Baseline][4] tests) have been chosen based on several factors including ease of use, ease of teaching, and accuracy of results. They are also free to install and use.

  * **ANDI (Accessible Name & Description Inspector)**, developed by the Social Security Administration, is a free open-source bookmarklet, which means that the tool does not require installation as a plugin and can be added to multiple browsers as a bookmark. 
      * [Install ANDI][5]
  * **Color Contrast Analyzer (CCA)**, developed by Steve Faulkner and the Paciello Group, is a free open-source tool that displays the contrast ratio for two selected colors. CCA is used to inspect color contrast when contrast cannot be programmatically identified by ANDI. 
      * [CCA 2.5 for Windows][6]
      * [CCA 2.4 for macOS][7]
