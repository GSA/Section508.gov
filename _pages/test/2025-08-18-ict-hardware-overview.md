Federal hardware information and communication technology (ICT) refers to physical technology products such as computers, mobile devices, and peripheral equipment, information kiosks and transaction machines, telecommunications equipment, customer premises equipment such as servers, and multifunction office machines such as printers. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires hardware ICT be usable by people with disabilities including features like tactile controls, adjustable displays, accessible ports, and compatibility with assistive technologies. <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#chapter-4-hardware" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external"> Chapter 4: Hardware</a> applies if the ICT is a tangible device or if it has a physical component.

## Definitions

The Section 508 Standards define <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E103-definitions" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">"hardware”</a> as “A tangible device, equipment, or physical component of ICT, such as telephones, computers, multifunction copy machines, and keyboards." 

**EXCEPTION:** Hardware that is assistive technology shall not be required to conform to the requirements of Chapter 4\.

## Applicability

Hardware ICT that is developed, used, maintained, or procured are subject to the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Section 508 Standards</a>.

Chapter 4 applies to ICT that is hardware as required by <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#508-chapter-2-scoping-requirements" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Chapter 2 of Section 508</a>and <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#255-chapter-2-scoping-requirements" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Chapter 2 of Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act</a>.

### What Is Not Considered ICT Hardware?

Some devices and components fall outside the scope of <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#chapter-4-hardware" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Chapter 4: Hardware</a> of the Section 508 Standards, even if they connect to ICT systems. Such items include: 

* Assistive technology (AT) used only by individuals with disabilities such as screen readers, augmentative communication devices, and specialty switches.  
* Non-electronic tools and office furniture, such as filing cabinets or analog signage.  
* Cables, power supplies, and passive adapters unless part of a bundled ICT product.

## Examples

* Self Service kiosks for checking in at the Social Security Administration  
* Employee laptops as furnished by the federal government   
* Printers available for professional use in Federal government buildings  
* Personal Identification Verification (PIV) cards used for access to government buildings  
* A National Park ticketing kiosk used to obtain access permits, make camping reservations or purchase admission tickets  
* A handheld Veteran’s Affairs hospital check in tablet
