## ICT Testing Baseline

Baseline tests&nbsp;of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) attempt to reduce ambiguity, increase consistency of results, and emphasize&nbsp;methods and techniques to reliably meet federal accessibility requirements.

The [ICT Testing Baseline][1] provides an approach to standardize and improve web accessibility conformance test processes throughout the federal government. It allows agencies the flexibility to customize their own test processes by incorporating the baseline tests and any additional tests to suit specific needs and contexts. Additionally, agencies can use the ICT Baseline to identify and report non-baseline tests separately from the baseline results, which can improve reporting transparency. It supports harmonization and interoperability of web accessibility test results and tools, and sharing of best practices and resources among digital accessibility professionals and stakeholders. It also helps ensure that web content is accessible to people with disabilities and meets the legal obligations of Section 508. 
Note: Add after the first sentence/paragraph.

The&nbsp;[ICT Testing Baseline][1] describes how to evaluate conformance to the [Revised 508 Standards][2], which align with WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria. It is organized by categories to help you easily identify applicable requirements. Note that the Baseline is not a test process and does not include testing tools; rather, it should be used to **create** an accessibility test process.

Email the ICT Baseline Working Group at <ictbaseline@gsa.gov> with questions.

## DHS Trusted Tester Process & Certification Program

The DHS Trusted Tester Process is a manual test approach that aligns with the ICT Testing Baseline, and provides repeatable and reliable conformance test results. DHS offers training and formal accessibility testing certification for using the DHS Trusted Tester Process. Agencies that adopt the Trusted Tester Process only accept test results from individuals who have been certified as Trusted Testers.
