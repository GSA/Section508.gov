## ICT Testing Baseline

Baseline tests&nbsp;of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) attempt to reduce ambiguity, increase consistency of results, and emphasize&nbsp;methods and techniques to reliably meet federal accessibility requirements.

The&nbsp;[ICT Testing Baseline][1] describes how to evaluate conformance to the [Revised 508 Standards][2], which align with WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria. It is organized by categories to help you easily identify applicable requirements. Note that the Baseline is not a test process and does not include testing tools; rather, it should be used to **create** an accessibility test process.

Email the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Accessibility Helpdesk at <Accessibility@HQ.DHS.GOV> with questions.

## DHS Trusted Tester Process & Certification Program

The DHS Trusted Tester Process is a manual test approach that aligns with the ICT Testing Baseline, and provides repeatable and reliable conformance test results. DHS offers training and formal accessibility testing certification for using the DHS Trusted Tester Process. Agencies that adopt the Trusted Tester Process only accept test results from individuals who have been certified as Trusted Testers.
