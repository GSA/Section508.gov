## ICT Testing Baseline

Baseline tests&nbsp;of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) attempt to reduce ambiguity, increase consistency of results, and emphasize&nbsp;methods and techniques to reliably meet federal accessibility requirements.

The [ICT Testing Baseline for Web][1] provides an approach to standardize and improve web accessibility conformance test processes throughout the federal government. Agencies may use the Baseline for Web as the foundation of their test methodology to evaluate web content for Section 508 conformance. Agencies may select testing tools that best suit their environment and include additional agency-specific tests. Including Baseline results in test reports can improve reporting transparency. The Baseline for Web improves the accuracy and completeness of web accessibility test results and the test methodologies that provide them. The Baseline for Web is a best practice and resource for web accessibility professionals and stakeholders. By improving conformance testing, it also helps ensure that web content is accessible to people with disabilities.

The [ICT Testing Baseline][1] describes how to evaluate conformance to the [Revised 508 Standards][2], which align with WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria. It is organized by categories to help you easily identify applicable requirements. Note that the Baseline is not a test process and does not include testing tools; rather, it should be used to **create** an accessibility test process.

Email the ICT Baseline Working Group at <ictbaseline@gsa.gov> with questions.

## DHS Trusted Tester Process & Certification Program

The DHS Trusted Tester Process is a manual test approach that aligns with the ICT Testing Baseline, and provides repeatable and reliable conformance test results. DHS offers training and formal accessibility testing certification for using the DHS Trusted Tester Process. Agencies that adopt the Trusted Tester Process only accept test results from individuals who have been certified as Trusted Testers.
