The foundation of any ICT accessibility program is a comprehensive Section 508 policy that applies across the entire agency and its missions. Your policy should outline how the agency will ensure ICT accessibility compliance in all aspects of technology---including acquisition, development, authoring, configuration, deployment, and maintenance---and should be explicitly referenced in other policies across these agency functions. (See [Policy Framework](https://www.section508.gov/manage/policy-framework/introduction/) for examples).

The purpose of this document is to provide example language you can use when developing your agency's Section 508 policy. The following policy template includes standard language organized across key sections:

<ul class="usa-icon-list">

    <span class="text-blue"><strong>Purpose:</strong> Describes the purpose of the document, which is to establish the agency's policy for ensuring access to information and communications technology (ICT) and compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

    <span class="text-blue"><strong>Scope:</strong> Outlines to whom this policy should apply, including the agency's employees and contractors who develop, procure, maintain, or use ICT.
