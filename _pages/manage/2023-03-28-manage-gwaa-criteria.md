title: "Government-wide Section 508 Assessment Criteria"
---
Below is a list of the criteria agencies must use to evaluate the extent to which the electronic and information technology of the agency are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. These questions are broken down into 11 different criteria; 9 focus on maturity, one dimension focuses on Section 508 conformance metrics and one general information section. This is the final list of the questions that your agency will need to submit responses on by August 11, 2023. We will provide a collection tool no later than June 1st for the designated individual to use to submit the information. Feel free to use the following [downloadable excel]() to help you collect the information; however, responses MUST be submitted using the collection tool. You may also simply print the criteria questions directly from this page as a guide.

## Conformance Metrics
Questions in Conformance Metrics ask about specific data points and outcomes related to measuring your program inclusion of ICT accessibility.
