title: 'Developing a Website Accessibility Statement'
---

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum, [“M-24-08 Strengthening Digital Accessibility and the Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act“][1] requires federal agencies to maintain an accessibility statement on their websites.

## Why Publish an Accessibility Statement
While federal agencies are required to provide an accessibility statement, we encourage all digital product owners to include information about an organization’s commitment towards providing equal access to information. In brief, it’s the perfect opportunity to engage customers with disabilities by highlighting relevant information to improve their customer experience. 

People who visit the website, particularly individuals with disabilities, will appreciate the open acknowledgement that accessibility is a key driver for the website. Users will also appreciate the ease of access to contact information and speedy responses and resolution should they encounter any barriers while using your website or digital service.

We recommend that each agency craft a message highlighting the agency’s commitment to ensuring equivalent access to information for people with disabilities, and provide information on the various points of contact, resources and services available to visitors and customers. 

## What to Include in an Accessibility Statement
Per M-24-08, A. Establish Digital Accessibility Programs and Policies, agencies shall maintain a digital accessibility statement on Federal websites that provides or links to the following information:

* The accessibility standard applied to the website and any known limitations or alternative versions, as appropriate;

* The contact information for the Section 508 program manager (name and email address);

* A public feedback mechanism that allows members of the public to report accessibility problems with agency websites and digital services to the agency’s Section 508 program as well as relevant implementation teams;

* Instructions for filing a complaint alleging a violation of Section 508;

* Information about the agency’s reasonable accommodations procedures for Federal employees and job applicants, consistent with Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act;

* Instructions on the use of the telecommunications relay service;

* Links to any relevant, publicly available organizational policies or procedures on digital accessibility; and

* Date that the digital accessibility statement was last updated or reviewed.

## Where to Publish an Accessibility Statement

To ensure that your accessibility statement is available to visitors at any point within their digital experience, agencies should include a link to the accessibility statement in the site-wide footer. Secondary sites may create their own footer and accessibility statement page or link to the domain website's accessibility statement.

Websites that conform with the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) should use the [`Identifier`](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/identifier/) component, which communicates a site’s parent agency and displays agency links required by federal laws and policies, and includes the accessibility statement by default (Figure 1).

<div class="tablet:grid-col" style="margin: auto; max-width: 90%; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px">
  <div class="margin-top-1"><img src="https://assets.section508.gov/files/images/policy-web-statement-uswds.png" alt="USWDS Identifier" aria-describedby="uswds-statement" class="border-2px border-base-light shadow-2 padding-1"></div>
  <div class="font-mono-3xs margin-x-auto auto" style="max-width: 90%; text-align: center;"><span id="uswds-statement">Figure 1: U.S. Web Design System `Identifier` component with the accessibility statement using the link text 'Accessibility statement' among other links such as FOIA requests, No FEAR Act data, and Privacy policy.</span></div>
</div>

Websites not utilizing the USWDS's `Identifier` component should ensure that a link to an accessibility statement is located in the site-wide footer of each page using “Accessibility” or “Accessibility Statement” as the link text (Figure 2). 

<div class="tablet:grid-col" style="margin: auto; max-width: 90%; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px">
  <div class="margin-top-1"><img src="https://assets.section508.gov/files/images/policy-web-statement-usab.png" alt="USAB Accessibility Statement" aria-describedby="usab-statement" class="border-2px border-base-light shadow-2 padding-1"></div>
  <div class="font-mono-3xs margin-x-auto auto" style="max-width: 90%; text-align: center;"><span id="usab-statement">Figure 2: U.S. Access Board's website accessibility statement using the link text 'Accessibility' among seven other links such as Guidance Documents, FOIA, and Privacy.</span></div>
</div>

Another acceptable approach is to include the accessibility statement among a series of website policies and notices using “Website Policy & Notices“ as the link text (Figure 3). 

<div class="tablet:grid-col" style="margin: auto; max-width: 90%; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px">
  <div class="margin-top-1"><img src="https://assets.section508.gov/files/images/policy-web-statement-fcc.png" alt="FCC Accessibility Statement" aria-describedby="fcc-statement" class="border-2px border-base-light shadow-2 padding-1"></div>
  <div class="font-mono-3xs margin-x-auto auto" style="max-width: 90%; text-align: center;"><span id="fcc-statement">Figure 3: Screenshot of the FCC's accessibility statement using the link text 'Website Policies & Notices' among eight other links such as Privacy Policy, FOIA, Enforcement, and About the FCC.</span></div>
</div>
