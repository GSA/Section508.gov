<p>On January 18, 2017, the U.S. Access Board issued a final rule (the “Revised 508 Standards”) that updated accessibility requirements covered by Section 508 for Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The final rule went into effect on January 18, 2018.</p>

<p>The Access Board rule updated and reorganized the Section 508 Standards (as well as the Section 255 Guidelines) in response to market trends and innovations in technology. The “refresh” also harmonized these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for digital content.</p>

<p>On August 11, 2021, the FAR Council (the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy and Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)) published a final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to incorporate these revisions and updates to ICT accessibility standards.</p>

<p>The full text and formal notice of the final rule is available at: <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/08/11/2021-16363/federal-acquisition-regulation-section-508-based-standards-in-information-and-communication" target="_blank">Federal Acquisition Regulation: Section 508-Based Standards in Information and Communication Technology (federalregister.gov/d/2021-16363).</a> The updates are  effective as of September 10, 2021.</p>

<h2>List of Amendments</h2>

<p>The FAR is updated to match the language used in the Revised 508 Standards.  For example, throughout “EIT” has been replaced with “ICT”.</p>

<p>The final rule amends 48 CFR parts 2, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 39 as set forth below. Changes are displayed as follows:</p>

<h3>Part 2 - Definitions of Words and Terms</h3>
<h4>2.101 Definitions</h4>

<p>The main change in this section is replacing “EIT” with “ICT”.  The included examples were also changed to match those used in the Revised 508 Standards.</p>

                <p>(a) Allowable exemptions. An agency may grant an exemption for the following:</p>
                <p>(1) Undue burden. When an agency determines the acquisition of ICT conforming with all the applicable ICT accessibility standards would impose an undue burden on the agency, compliance with the ICT accessibility standards is only required to the extent that it would not impose an undue burden. In determining whether conformance to one or more ICT accessibility standards would impose an undue burden, an agency shall consider the extent to which conformance would impose significant difficulty or expense considering the agency resources available to the program or component for which the ICT supply or service is being procured.</p>
                <p>(2) Fundamental alteration. When an agency determines that acquisition of ICT that conforms with all applicable ICT accessibility standards would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT, such acquisition is required to conform only to the extent that conformance will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT.</p>
                <p>(3) Nonavailability of conforming commercial items. Where there are no commercial items that fully conform to the ICT accessibility standards, the agency shall procure the supplies or service available in the commercial marketplace that best meets the ICT accessibility standards consistent with the agency's needs.</p>
                <p>(b) Alternative means of access. An agency shall provide individuals with disabilities access to and use of information and data by an alternative means to meet the identified needs when an exemption in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section applies.</p>
                <p>(c) Documentation. When an exemption applies, the contracting officer shall obtain, as part of the requirements documentation, a written determination from the requiring activity explaining the basis for the exemption in paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section. This documentation shall be maintained in the contract file.</p>
                <p>(1) Undue burden. A determination of undue burden shall address why and to what extent compliance with applicable ICT accessibility standards constitutes an undue burden.</p>
                <p>(2) Fundamental alteration. A determination of fundamental alteration shall address the extent to which compliance with the applicable ICT accessibility standards would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT.</p>
                <p>(3) Nonavailability of conforming commercial items. A determination of commercial items nonavailability shall include—</p>
                <p>(i) A description of the market research performed;</p>
                <p>(ii) A listing of the requirements that cannot be met; and</p>
                <p>(iii) The rationale for determining that the ICT to be procured best meets the ICT accessibility standards in 36 CFR 1194.1, consistent with the agency's needs.</p>
