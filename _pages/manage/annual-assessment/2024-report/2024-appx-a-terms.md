      <td>An Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) is a document that explains the extent to which a product conforms to accessibility standards such as WCAG or Section 508 Technical Standards. A common way an ACR is completed is by using the VPAT® template created by the IT Industry Council (ITI), but other methods are used across government.</td>

        <p>Within this document, “agency” includes any federal department, component- level, and independent agencies subject to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act; generally used where this report offers recommendations and shares GSA efforts to increase Section 508 compliance.</p>
        <p>This report uses the term “reporting entity” rather than “agency” or “component” as traditionally defined because reporting entity Section 508 Programs may be organized and function outside of these traditional definitions; generally used for data-driven findings, observations and overall performance category recommendations.</p>
