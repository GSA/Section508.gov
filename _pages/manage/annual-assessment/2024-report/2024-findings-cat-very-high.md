## Very High Maturity - Very Low Conformance
There are no reporting entities that fell into the Very High Maturity-Very Low Conformance Category.

<hr class="breaker-bar-green">

<!-- VH-L -->
## Very High Maturity - Low Conformance

* Number of Entities in Category: 3

* Average Maturity Score: 4.18

* Average Conformance Score: 1.74

* Two Lowest Average Dimensions: Policies, Procedures and Practices (3.47), Training (3.54)

* Two Highest Average Maturity Scores: Technology Lifecycle Activities (4.90) Communications (4.69)

### Highlighted Outcomes:

* All entities reported Section 508 is almost always included in ICT governance processes such as milestone reviews, publication or deployment decisions, change control reviews, etc.

* All entities reported their entity almost always includes sufficient ICT accessibility requirements in solicitations.

* All entities reported either none of their top 10 viewed internal intranet pages tested were fully conformant (1 entity, 33%) or that the entity does not have resources to test their top 10 internal internet pages.

* All entities reported either none of the entity’s top 10 viewed videos fully conformed to Section 508 standards (2 entities, 67%) or they did not have the resources to test (1 entity, 33%).

* All entities reported both the surveys distributed by the reporting entity and their enterprise-wide chat or internal real-time messaging system conformed to 90% to 99% of applicable Section 508 requirements.

* Entities in this category performed below trend in the Policies, Procedures, and Practices Dimension and above trend in the Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership Dimension.

### Summary
Those in the Very High-Low overall performance category should invest in testing efforts and resource allocation in order to improve their testing consistency and conformance outcomes.

## Very High Maturity - Moderate Conformance

* Number of Entities in Category: 2

* Average Maturity Score: 4.51

* Average Conformance Score: 2.88

* Two Lowest Average Dimensions: Content Creation (3.44), Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership (3.75)

* Two Highest Average Maturity Scores: Communications (5.00), Acquisition and Procurement (5.00)

### Highlighted Outcomes:

* All entities reported that they implement a documented complaint process with specific procedures for reporting, assessing, tracking, and resolving Section 508 complaints.

* 1 entity (50%) reported they offer ICT accessibility-related training to employees, including training on guidance, templates, and tools for creating accessible content approximately 5 to 6 times per year. The other entity (50%) reported that it provided training 7 or more times per year.

* All entities said none of their top 10 viewed documents tested fully conformed to Section 508 standards.

* All entities said the reporting entity's publicly-posted Section 508 or ICT accessibility policy conformed to 90% to 99% of relevant Section 508 requirements.

* Entities in this category performed below trend in the Content Creation Dimension and above trend in the Policies, Procedures and Practices, Communications, and Acquisition and Procurement Dimensions.

### Summary
Those in the Very High-Moderate overall performance category should invest in testing efforts and resource allocation in order to improve their testing consistency and conformance outcomes, particularly for internet, intranet and documents testing.

## Very High Maturity - High Conformance

* Number of entities in Category: 4

* Average Maturity Score: 4.51

* Average Conformance Score: 3.54

* Two Lowest Average Dimensions: Policies, Procedures, and Practices (4.06), Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership (4.06)

* Two Highest Average Maturity Scores: IT Accessibility Program Office (4.94), Technology Lifecycle Activities (4.92)

### Highlighted Outcomes:

* 2 entities (50%) reported that nonconformant digital content is always or almost always tracked and remediated within the reporting entity. The other two entities (50%) said they frequently track and remediate content.

* All entities said ICT accessibility core values have been included in the reporting entity DEIA and mission-related strategic plan, and leadership regularly communicates this core value.

* All 4 entities tested their top 10 public-facing electronic documents with varying degrees of conformance: 1 entity with 20% conformance, one with 30% conformance, one with 40% conformance (and testing only 5 documents), and the final entity with 90% conformance.

* 100% of entities tested their top 5 videos with all being fully conformant.

* Entities in this category performed below trend in the Testing and validation Dimension and above trend in the IT Accessibility Program Office Dimension.

### Summary
Those in the Very High-High overall performance category should continue to make incremental improvements particularly in their testing and remediation efforts due to the variability in conformance results.
