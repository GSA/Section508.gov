Reporting entities are listed in alphabetical order beginning with Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act departments and component reporting entities followed by independent reporting entities.<sup><a href="#fn38" id="fr38">38</a></sup> Due to similarities of some reporting entity names, respondent acronyms used in this report may be different than those used by the reporting entities.

Comprehensive submission data by reporting entity can be found at Section508.gov under Annual Reports. In addition, a supplemental data dictionary details the Assessment criteria, answer selections, dependencies, “understanding content” and variable identifiers.

* Reporting entity seal or logo

* Reporting entity name

* Identification of parent agency, if applicable

* Overall Performance, consisting of:

  * Maturity Bracket: This measure of a reporting entity’s Section 508 program maturity assesses responses to criteria across nine dimensions. All were multiple choice format, equally weighted, and scored as noted in Methods, Descriptive Analysis. This maturity bracket consists of an index using a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 representing very low and 5 representing very high maturity levels.

  * Conformance Bracket: This measure of a reporting entity’s conformance metrics consists of an index using a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 representing very low and 5 representing very high conformance. This conformance index quantified select responses to 16 specific criteria in the conformance section of criteria which directly relate to quantifiable compliance outcomes. They were assigned numerical values and weighted as shown in Table B2.

  * Recommendations specific to the reporting entity overall performance bracket

  * Visual of where the reporting entity falls on the 5 x 5 matrix for maturity and conformance, with very low in the bottom left corner and very high in the top right corner. For entities with two years of data, there is a depiction of FY23 and FY24 results in the matrix.
1 Reporting entity denotes a respondent to the Assessment. This report uses the term “reporting entity” rather than “agency” or “component” as traditionally defined because reporting entity Section 508 programs may be organized or function outside of these
traditional definitions.

* Program Highlights show reporting entity responses to Questions 42, 44, and 50.

* Number of Section 508 program Contractor full time equivalents (FTEs).

* Number of Section 508 program Federal FTEs.

* Total number of reporting entity Section 508 program FTEs compared to the average of Section 508 FTEs among reporting entity maturity dimension.

* Hours per week spent by the reporting entity Section 508 Program Manager (PM) compared to average Section 508 PM hours among reporting entity maturity dimension.

* Table comparing maturity outcomes for FY23 and FY24, averaged by dimension with five possible brackets:

  * Lowest and highest FY24 maturity dimensions are showcased with a double asterisk and a highlight in red denoting the lowest, and a single asterisk and a highlight in green denoting highest. Behind each bracket category is a numerical average of reporting entity responses. The lowest dimension highlighted does not imply this must be the first line of business the reporting entity should invest in; it only depicts the lowest ranking. Entities should determine the best course of action for their investment in Section 508 compliance.

* If a reporting entity did not perform dimension functions, a “^” is next to the dimension.

* "How Conformant is ICT?” shows responses of conformance levels for specific ICT products in Questions 80-89:

  * Unknown

  * N/A = Not Applicable

  * 100% = Conforms to 100% of applicable Section 508 requirements

  * 90% - 99% = Conforms to 90% - 99% of applicable Section 508 requirements 

  * 50% - 90% = Conforms to 50% - 90% of applicable Section 508 requirements 

  * < 50% = Conforms to less than 50% of applicable Section 508 requirements

* ICT Testing Outcomes compare FY23 and FY24 results of:

  * All internal and public internet web pages tested as part of standard business operation. Data shown represents the percentage of ICT tested that fully conforms to Section 508 standards, i.e., did not have any defects reported, Not Tested, or Not Applicable.

  * Top 10 viewed internal intranet web pages, public web pages, public electronic documents, and top five viewed videos. Reporting entities were asked to identify top viewed ICT and fully test each ICT and report defects identified by Section 508 standard. Data shown represents the percentage of ICT tested that fully conforms to Section 508 standards, i.e., did not have any defects reported, Not Tested due to lack of resources, or Not Applicable as entity does not have that type of ICT.
