As previously mentioned, categories are composed of the maturity and conformance index pairs, such as High Maturity High Conformance (High-High), Low Maturity High Conformance (Low-High), etc. In total, there are 25 categories that include all the combinations of the two scales that range from Very Low to Very High for both Maturity and Conformance as explained in the section discussing [Assessment Indices and Reporting Entity Scatter Plot]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/section-508-assessment/2024/findings/maturity-dimension/).
