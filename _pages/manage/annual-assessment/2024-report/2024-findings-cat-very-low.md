## Very Low Maturity - Very Low Conformance

* Number of Entities in Category: 20

* Average Maturity Score: 0.49

* Average Conformance Score: 0.47

* Two Lowest Average Dimensions: Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership (0.31), Testing and Validation (0.45)

* Two Highest Average Maturity Scores: Communications (0.77) and IT Accessibility Program Office (0.70)
 
### Highlighted Outcomes:

-   15 entities (75%) said they did not have the resources to test for accessible videos.

-   17 entities (85%) said their Section 508 policy is either in draft (5 entities, 25%), does not exist (10 entities, 50%) or is unknown to exist (2 entities, 10%). Only 3 entities (15%) in this category said they had a published Section 508 or ICT accessibility policy, but did not include all relevant M-24-08 and Section 508 statutory requirements. No respondents picked the top 2 responses for this question.

-   Entities performed well relative to others in the Very Low Maturity bracket in Policies, Procedures, and Practices, but somewhat behind the trend in the Acquisitions and Procurement.

### Summary

Those in the Very Low-Very Low overall performance category have several areas where they may invest. However, given the low response rate for testing of ICT to ensure adherence to Section 508 standards, a first suggestion would be to expand accessibility testing practices and increase resourcing for testing of ICT.

## Very Low Maturity - Low Conformance  
* Number of Entities in Category: 34

* Average Maturity Score: 1.50

* Average Conformance Score: 0.54

* Two Lowest Average Dimensions: Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership (0.97), Training  (1.07)

* Two Highest Average Maturity Scores: Communications (2.17), Content Creation (1.78)

### Highlighted Outcomes:
* 24 entities (71%) said the entity does not have a Section 508 Program or one is in development but not yet established.

* 31 entities (91%) said they did not have the resources to test their top five-viewed videos, while the other three did not have any conformant videos. All entities received a zero for this criteria.

* Entities in this category performed above trend in Communications and Policies, Procedures, and Practices, while being slightly below trend in Testing and Validation.

### Summary
Those in the Low-Very Low overall performance category should continue to invest in establishing a Section 508 Program Office at the entity, as well as investing in their testing activities including allocating resources to testing their top-viewed ICT.

## Very Low Maturity - Moderate Conformance
* Number of entities in Category: 2

* Average Maturity Score: 0.66

* Average Conformance Score: 2.12

* Two Lowest Average Dimensions: Training (0.00), Policies, Procedures and Practices (0.00), and Communications (0.00)

* Two Highest Average Maturity Scores: Acquisition and Procurement (1.67), Technology Lifecycle Activities (1.25), and IT Accessibility Program Office (1.25)

### Highlighted Outcomes:
* 2 entities (100%) said web content either never receives comprehensive Section 508 conformance validation testing – internet and intranet – prior to deployment (1 entity) or that it is unknown if manual testing is done (1 entity). 

* One entity said a Section 508 Program or equivalent is in development. The other simply said they do not have a formal Section 508 Program or equivalent.

* Entities in this category performed above trend than others in the Very Low Maturity bracket in Technology Lifecycle Activity and Acquisition and Procurement dimensions, while performing under trend in the Policies, Procedures and Practices, Communications, Content Creation, and Training Dimensions.

### Summary 
Those in the Very Low-Moderate overall performance category should invest in establishing a Section 508 Program Office at the entity, as well as establishing a baseline for those activities that are currently not being performed – specifically accessibility-related activities aligned to Training, Communications and Policies, Procedures, and Practices.
