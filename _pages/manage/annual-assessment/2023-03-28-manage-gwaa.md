On December 29, 2022, the <a href=”https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617” target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023</a>was signed, which amended <a href=”https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/section-508-law/#794d-1” target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794d-1)</a>. The amendment requires federal agencies to annually assess and report their efforts to ensure electronic and information technology is accessible to individuals with disabilities, in accordance with updated standards and guidance.

Each year:
* The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Access Board, must issue criteria and instructions to agencies.
* Agencies must submit responses to OMB and GSA by the specified deadline.
* GSA, in consultation with OMB, must publicly publish a report including:
  * A comprehensive assessment by agency and governmentwide generally of compliance to accessibility standards.
  * A detailed description of actions and efforts that GSA took to support compliance at agencies over the past year and planned efforts to do the same.
  * A list of recommendations to Congress to help support accessibility compliance.

## Assessment Reports
Annual assessment reports are made available on this website in HTML or as a downloadable PDF document file for offline reading.
