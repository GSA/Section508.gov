Reporting entities are listed in alphabetical order beginning with CFO Act departments and component reporting entities followed by independent reporting entities<sup><a href="#fn39" id="fr39">39</a></sup>. Due to similarities of some reporting entity names, reporting entity acronyms used in this report may not reflect the initialism used by those reporting entities and altered solely to ensure data integrity during the collection, analysis, reporting and associated open data made available as part of this Assessment.

Comprehensive submission data by reporting entity can be found at: [Section508.gov/2023-congressional-report](https://www.section508.gov/2023-congressional-report/). In addition, a supplemental data dictionary details the Assessment criteria, answer selections, dependencies, “understanding content” and variable identifiers.

* Reporting entity seal/logo

* Reporting entity name
            
* Identification of parent agency (if applicable)
            
* Maturity Bracket: This measure of a reporting entity’s Section 508 Program maturity assesses responses to criteria across 9 dimensions, encompassed Questions 22 to 61 except Q27B (See <a href="https://assets.section508.gov/assets/files/assessment/2023/FY23%20Governmentwide%20Section%20508%20Assessment%20Data%20Dictionary%20Excel.xlsx">FY23 Data Dictionary (XLSX)</a>), and all were multiple choice format, equally weighted, and scored as noted in Methods, Descriptive Analysis. This maturity bracket consists of an index using a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 representing very low and 5 representing very high maturity levels.

* Conformance Bracket: This measure of a reporting entity’s Conformance Metrics consists of an index using a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 representing very low and 5 representing very high conformance. This index quantified select responses to 16 specific criteria in the Conformance section of criteria which directly relate to quantifiable compliance outcomes and included: Q61, Q79, Q71,Q78, Q80 to Q85, and Q87 to Q92 (See <a href="https://assets.section508.gov/assets/files/assessment/2023/FY23%20Governmentwide%20Section%20508%20Assessment%20Data%20Dictionary%20Excel.xlsx">FY23 Data Dictionary (XLSX)</a>). They were assigned numerical values and weighted as shown in Table C2. 

* Recommendations specific to the reporting entity bracket linked to Maturity-Conformance category (within Findings).

* Visual of where the reporting entity falls on the 5 x 5 matrix for maturity and conformance, with Very Low in the bottom left corner and Very High in the top right corner.

* ICT Testing Outcomes for reporting entity’s top viewed internal intranet web pages (up to 10 web pages), public web pages (up to 10 web pages), public electronic documents (up to 10 electronic documents), and videos (up to 5 videos) within the reporting period. Reporting entities were asked to identify top viewed ICT and fully test each ICT and report the number of defects identified by Section 508 standard. Data shown represents the percentage of ICT tested that fully conforms to Section 508 standards (i.e., did not have any defects reported).

* Does Agency ICT Fully Conform? depicts responses for specific ICT products*:

  * Unknown= Unk

  * N/A = Not Applicable

  * Yes

  * YA = Yes, all (indicating all ICT fully conforms and only applies to public desktop/mobile apps and kiosks)

  * YS = Yes, some (indicating only some of the ICT fully conforms and only applies to public desktop/mobile apps and kiosks)

  * No

* Section 508 Program and Policy Highlights show reporting entity responses to question 22
and question 28*

* Number of Section 508 Program Contractor FTE(s)*

* Number of Section 508 Program Federal FTE(s)*

* Total number of reporting entity Section 508 Program FTEs compared to the average of 508 FTEs among reporting entity maturity dimension

* Hours per week spent by the reporting entity Section 508 Program Manager (PM)* compared to average Section 508 PM hours among reporting entity maturity dimension

* Table of reporting entity maturity outcomes, averaged by dimension (with 5 possible brackets)

  * Lowest (with a double asterisk and a highlight in red) and highest (with a single asterisk and a highlight in green) maturity dimensions are showcased (behind each bracket category is a numerical average of reporting entity responses). The lowest dimension highlighted does not imply this must be the first line of business the reporting entity should invest in; it only depicts the lowest ranking. Entities should determine the best course of action for their investment in Section 508 compliance.

  * If a reporting entity did not perform dimension functions, a “^” is next to the dimension; a Very High will also display as the bracket result.
