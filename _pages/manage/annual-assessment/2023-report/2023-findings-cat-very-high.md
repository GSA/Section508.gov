## Very High Maturity - Very Low Conformance

  <p><ul class="list-item-spacer">
    <li>Reporting Entity Count: 1</li>
    <li>Lowest Maturity Dimension: Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership (average score: 3.13)</li>
    <li>Second Lowest Maturity Dimension: IT Accessibility Program Office; Policy, Procedures and Practices; Testing (average score: 3.75)</li>

## Highlighted Category Statistics
* The only reporting entity in this category indicated that their Section 508 Program or equivalent never engages with disability-related affinity groups.

* The only reporting entity in this category includes consideration for ICT accessibility in its policy and directive creation, review, and management process, and most or all relevant policies include consideration for ICT accessibility requirements.

* Reporting entity reported testing its internet pages, but reported 0% conformance.

* Reporting entity reported that it did not have any resources to test the top internet pages,
intranet pages, documents or videos requested by the Assessment .

## Overall Recommendations
The only reporting entity in the Very High-Very Low category is relatively mature but could incrementally invest in Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership, and Testing activities. However, maturity does not seem to translate to in-practice activities given the testing outcomes . We recommend prioritizing the allocation of resources to test and ensure robust processes are created and followed to verify conformant digital content is created.

## Highlighted Category Statistics
* Reporting entity said it had the highest rating for every criteria across all maturity dimensions.

* Reporting entity said it did not have any resources to test the top internet pages, intranet
pages, documents or videos requested by the Assessment.

## Overall Recommendations
The only reporting entity in the Very High-Low category reported the highest maturity rating
for every criteria across all maturity dimensions. Maturity does not seem to relate to in-practice activities given the testing outcomes. We recommend prioritizing the allocation of resources to test and ensure robust processes are created and followed to verify conformant digital content is created.

## Very High Maturity - Moderate Conformance
<div class="border-base padding-1 callout-box-bottom-left" style="width: auto;">
  <p><ul class="list-item-spacer">
    <li>Reporting Entity Count: 4</li>
    <li>Lowest Maturity Dimension: Training (average score: 3.36)</li>
    <li>Second Lowest Maturity Dimension: Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership (average score: 3.83)</li>
    <li>Highest Maturity Dimension: IT Accessibility Program (average score: 4.88)</li>
    <li>Second Highest Maturity Dimension: Policies, Procedures and Practices (average score: 4.77)</li>
    <li>Average Maturity Score: 4.38</li>
    <li>Average Conformance Score: 2.64</li>
  </ul></p>
</div>

## Highlighted Category Statistics
* All reporting entities in this category indicated ICT accessibility requirements are almost always included in the technology development lifecycle, or they do not have or need a technology development lifecycle.

* All reporting entities in this category responded that their Section 508 PM or equivalent possesses expertise in the field of ICT accessibility, regularly meets and exceeds performance goals, and contributes to best practices in Section 508 Program Management across government.

* 3 of 4 reporting entities in this category (75%) only have a general Section 508 training plan that does not specify training needs and training curriculum by ICT roles and responsibilities.

* All reporting entities test their web pages for conformance and all reported over 70% conformance of pages tested within the reporting period.

* All reporting entities either did not have the resources to test their Top 10 intranet or internet pages or reported 0% conformance of those pages tested.

* All reporting entities reported that their time and attendance system and their most taken training were fully conformant.

## Overall Recommendations
Reporting entities in the Very High-Moderate category are relatively mature but should consider improving areas related to Training, Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership. Although reporting entities had Very High maturity, this led to relatively mixed conformance outcomes. We suggest reporting entities allocate additional resources to test to ensure conformance for ICT and digital content in particular.

<div class="border-base padding-1 callout-box-bottom-left" style="width: auto;">
  <p><ul class="list-item-spacer">
    <li>Reporting Entity Count: 3</li>
    <li>Lowest Maturity Dimension: Policies, Procedures and Practices (average score: 3.85)</li>
    <li>Second Lowest Maturity Dimension: IT Accessibility Program (average score: 4.25)</li>
    <li>Highest Maturity Dimension: Communications; Content Creation (average score: 5)</li>
    <li>Second Highest Maturity Dimension: Technology Lifecycle Activities (average score: 4.69)</li>
    <li>Average Maturity Score: 4.50</li>
    <li>Average Conformance Score: 3.50</li>
  </ul></p>
</div>

## Highlighted Category Statistics:
* All reporting entities in this category rank the severity of non-conformance issues and almost always remediate high severity issues immediately, resulting in little to no impact on users with disabilities.

* All reporting entities in this category responded that their reporting entityâ€™s Section 508 PM or equivalent possesses expertise in the field of ICT accessibility, regularly meets and exceeds performance goals, and contributes to best practices in Section 508 Program Management across government.

* All reporting entities in this category always or almost always create conformant content that does not require remediation, or they always or almost always take action on a plan to remediate the non-conformant content when identified.

* All reporting entities indicated they test their intranet and internet pages, with over 88% conformance for internet testing, and 2 of 3 reporting 85% or above for intranet testing.

* Reporting entities reported none of the intranet pages that were tested were deemed fully conformant.

## Overall Recommendations
While the reporting entities in the Very High-High category are relatively mature, on average they could invest in initiatives targeted at improving their performance in Policies, Procedures and Practices. Additionally, we suggest adding testing resources to improve document accessibility and intranet testing accessibility across the category.
