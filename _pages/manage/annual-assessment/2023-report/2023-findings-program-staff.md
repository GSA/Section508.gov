        <p>The majority of reporting entities (128 reporting entities or 51%) reported their Section 508 PM or equivalent worked part time, with a governmentwide average of part-time PMs dedicating eight hours per week to the Section 508 Program or equivalent.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fr13">13</a></sup></p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 10, 70 reporting entities (28%) reported having a full-time Section 508 PM dedicated to the reporting entity Section 508 Program, while 51 reporting entities (20%) reported having no Section 508 PM or equivalent.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fr14">14</a></sup></p>

  <p>In addition, regression analysis showed that <strong>the number of hours per week a Section 508 PM supported a Section 508 Program (Q3 (See <a href="https://training.section508.gov/assets/files/assessment/2023/FY23%20Governmentwide%20Section%20508%20Assessment%20Data%20Dictionary%20Excel.xlsx">FY23 Data Dictionary (XLSX)</a>)) predicted the status of the Section 508 Program (Q22)</strong>. For every extra hour spent, the likelihood of a more mature Section 508 Program status increased by 0.048.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fr15">15</a></sup> This shows the more time Section 508 PMs invest results in a higher maturity of the Section 508 Program. Similarly, <strong>the number of hours per week a Section 508 PM supported a Section 508 Program (Q3) predicted the amount of resources and staffing within the Section 508 Program (Q26)</strong>, highlighting the positive impact of increased dedication to Section 508 Program management on resource allocation within federal reporting entities. Every additional hour the Section 508 PM spent translated into a 0.023 governmentwide increase in resources and staffing.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fr16">16</a></sup></p>

Table 4 depicts the average hours per week Section 508 PMs dedicate to their Section 508 Program by maturity bracket. This shows that as maturity increases, so does the average number of hours per week a Section 508 PM dedicates to the Section 508 Program; or vice versa, the more time a Section 508 PM dedicates to their Program, the more mature the Program is.

### Section 508 FTEs
<div class="grid-row">
    <div class="desktop:grid-col-6 tablet:grid-col-6 mobile-lg-12">
        <p>Varying levels of Section 508 Program resourcing were reported governmentwide. <strong>Ninety-three (93) respondents (37%) reported less than 1 Section 508 FTE</strong>, with <strong>36 of those reporting entities reporting no Section 508 FTE</strong>.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fr17">17</a></sup> Governmentwide, the average number of Section 508 FTEs was reported at 4.3, comprising an average of 2.7 federal and 1.6 contractor Section 508 FTEs. Figure 11 below demonstrates the average of total Section 508 FTEs for all reporting entities that fell within each maturity  bracket, regardless of their conformance bracket. <strong>More mature reporting entities tended to have larger Section 508 Program support staff.</strong></p>
        <p>In Figure 12 below, GSA determined the average of total Section 508 FTEs for all reporting entities that fell within each conformance bracket, regardless of their maturity  bracket. As depicted, higher performing reporting entities tended to have larger Section 508 Program support staff. Similar to maturity, the more resources a reporting entity has at their disposal, the higher ICT conformance  they tend to have.</p>

<span id="performance-accountability">The numbers above only factored in Section 508 FTEs directly supporting the reporting entity Section 508 Program. For some respondents, this data may have underrepresented the number of Section 508s FTEs throughout the reporting entity. For example, excluding developer and testing staff embedded in other programs or resources utilized from parent or component-level reporting entities. To balance this, several questions highlighted the following competencies of all reporting entity staff involved in ICT conformance:</span>

* Only 65 respondents (26%) indicated they include Section 508 conformance in ICT-related leadership and management performance plans. Figure 13 below depicts the further breakdown of responses, noting that 68 reporting entities (27%) reported having no plans to do so, 33 reporting entities (13%) reported having a timetable to begin implementation, and 83 reporting entities (33%) did not know if Section 508 conformance was included in ICT-related leadership and management performance plans.

* 157 reporting entities (63%) responded that they <strong>do not integrate ICT accessibility into professional development plans</strong> for staff responsible for ensuring ICT conforms to Section 508 standards, with 84 of those reporting entities (34%) having no plans to do so and 73 reporting entities (29%) noting a plan to do so in the future.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fr18">18</a></sup>

* 126 reporting entities (50%) responded that staff who are involved in technology development lifecycle activities either <strong>sometimes or never have sufficient knowledge</strong> and skill to ensure ICT is Section 508 conformant, with 17 reporting entities reporting they have no knowledgeable staff.

* 158 reporting entities (64%) said they had <strong>no or only some development and testing professionals trained in Section 508 web testing</strong>.

Staff training emerged as a low scoring maturity dimension with <strong>only 56 of reporting entities (22%) implementing mandatory Section 508 training for all employees</strong>. Of those, a few reporting entities indicated that the required Section 508 awareness training was part of a one-time requirement while the majority of the reporting entities reported the training was required on a regular basis (e.g., annually). 

A significant number of reporting entities <strong>(114 reporting entities or 46%) reported that Section 508 training is not required for employees</strong>. However, 79 reporting entities (32%) indicated the following roles for which Section 508 training was mandatory:

Additional Training dimension highlights include:

* 120 reporting entities (48%) reported offering an <strong>optional Section 508 awareness training</strong> that employees sometimes take, but generally on an ad-hoc basis.

* 150 reporting entities (60%) indicated they have <strong>limited to no capacity to provide ICT accessibility-related training</strong> for employees.

* 109 reporting entities (44%) <strong>lack any Section 508 training plan</strong> that defines training needs and training curriculum by ICT roles and responsibilities.

* 167 reporting entities (67%) reported their <strong>level of employee training</strong> on guidance, templates and tools used to create Section 508 conformant content ranges from none to some training, and generally on an ad hoc basis.

### Section 508 Program 

Across government, the state of Section 508 Programs also varied. Similar to reporting entity staffing, almost half of respondents (119 reporting entities or 48%) said they have <strong>no formal Section 508 Program or equivalent, or their formal Section 508 Program or equivalent is in development</strong> (as shown in the bottom two bars in Figure 14).

    </div>
</div>

Almost <strong>half of respondents (114 reporting entities or 46%) reported that they do not have a published, detailed Section 508 policy</strong>. This is comprised of:

* 39 reporting entities (16%) who reported a policy does not exist.

* 30 reporting entities (12%) whose policy is in draft.

* 31 reporting entities (12%) who have a high-level Section 508/ICT accessibility policy signed but needs to be revised or more detail included.

* 14 reporting entities (6%) who did not know the status of their Section 508 policy.

    </div>
</div>

Data also shows that there is <strong>no correlation</strong> with overall Section 508 performance and where the Section 508 program resides within the organization. The majority of the respondents (166 reporting entities or 67%) reported they reside within the CIO Office or equivalent, with the remaining respondents noting the following:

* 39 respondents selected Other, with several noting a location in communications

* 30 respondents selected not applicable because there is no established formal program or office to implement and comply with Section 508

* 5 respondents selected head of agency’s office or equivalent

* 4 respondents selected General Counsel

* 3 respondents selected Equal Employment Office or equivalent

* 2 respondents selected Human Resource / Human Capital Office or equivalent

### Conclusion

These findings underscore that resourcing for Section 508 Programs is lacking across government, including a dedicated and resourced Section 508 PM and sufficient staff to perform the work. Reporting entities largely do not mandate any Section 508 training for their employees, either as a one-time training or on a regular basis. They also lack sufficient resources to be able to offer ICT accessibility-related training to employees, including on guidance, templates and tools used to create Section 508 conformant content. Without knowledgeable senior staff to provide leadership and management, alongside appropriate staffing to perform the work, Section 508 compliance suffers.
