---
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Access Board (USAB) have created a number of resources for agencies to use when preparing to submit their Section 508 assessment.

## Have a Question?
Before reaching out to the team directly, please review the resources below, which provide information to help you complete your agency assessment. These may answer your questions more quickly than waiting for a return email.
- [Instructions][1]
- [Assessment Criteria][2] 
<!-- - [Supplemental Guide][3] -->
- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)][4]
- [Definition of Terms][5]

If these resources don’t answer your question, or you wish to report an issue with this website, please contact us via email at:
- GSA at <Section.508@gsa.gov> for questions regarding the criteria, instructions and reporting tool access;  
- U.S. Access Board at <508@access-board.gov> for questions regarding Section 508 Standards.  

## Office Hours
During the reporting period, GSA, USAB and OMB will schedule “office hours” meetings, or times when your agency’s point of contact can meet with our team to discuss questions related to completing the assessment.
For more information on upcoming office hours, visit [Events][6].
