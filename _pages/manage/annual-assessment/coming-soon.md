[Section 752 of the FY2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr2617/BILLS-117hr2617enr.pdf#page=261) tasked Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Access Board (USAB), to update criteria and instructions for evaluating agenciesâ€™ Section 508 efforts.  Section 752 requires federal agencies to annually report on the implementation of Section 508 in accordance with the updated criteria and instructions by July 2024.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/section-508-assessment/annual-reports/">The Government-wide Section 508 Assessment</a> will replace the previously required biannual Section 508 program maturity reporting.

<div class="border-base radius-lg border-1px padding-1 bg-primary-lighter" style="margin-top: 1.0em;">
    <strong>Updated instructions and criteria will be posted to Section508.gov in April 2024.</strong>
