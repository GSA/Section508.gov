This guide highlights laws, policies and other regulations requiring federal agencies ensure employees and members of the public with disabilities have access to information comparable to the access available to others. While individuals may benefit from an awareness of all related regulation, each of the guide's sections suggest where a particular audience may have a responsibility. 

## Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. The law <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/laws-and-policies/section-508-law/">29 U.S.C &sect; 794d</a> applies to all federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508, agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information comparable to the access available to others.

The <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">U.S. Access Board</a> is responsible for developing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility standards to incorporate into regulations that govern federal procurement practices. On January 18, 2017, the Access Board issued a final rule that updated accessibility requirements covered by Section 508 and refreshed guidelines for telecommunications equipment subject to Section 255 of the Communications Act. The final rule went into effect on January 18, 2018.

The rule updated and reorganized the Section 508 Standards and Section 255 Guidelines in response to market trends and innovations in technology. The refresh also harmonized these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission, and with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for web content and ICT.

## Agency Policies
<strong>Audience: </strong> Agency Section 508 Program Managers, Human Resources, EEO, and Disability Employment Program Managers, or equivalents, or equivalents.

Agencies should periodically review and update their Sections 508, 501, and 504 policies. Your agency's policies on how to implement each section of the Rehabilitation Act should be closely aligned to clarify responsibilities and determine how to respond to claims of discrimination on the basis of disability.

Your agency’s policies should include that your agency is obligated to:

  * Make Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessible to people with disabilities.
  * Accommodate the needs of employees and program participants, while meeting the Revised Section 508 requirements.

Learn how to maintain your agency’s policies through the links below:

* [Updating Agency Accessibility Policy]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/laws-and-policies/update-agency-policies/)
* [IT Accessibility Policy Framework]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/introduction/)

### Workforce Policies
<strong>Audience: </strong> Agency leadership, Section 508 Program Managers, Human Resources, EEO, and Disability Employment Program Managers, or equivalents.

​​In addition to accessibility-related policies, other agency policies often require the development or use of specific ICT by the agency’s workforce. In order for an agency’s accessibility effort to be successful, employees and organizations must integrate accessibility into outcomes. In addition, other policies should be reviewed and updated to ensure that accessibility adequately addresses individual and organizational [roles & responsibilities]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/roles/) including:

* [Agency Program Management]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/roles/#management)
* [Key Agency Stakeholders]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/roles/#stakeholders)
* [Reporting]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/roles/#reporting)
