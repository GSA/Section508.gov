On April 15, 2025, the Executive Order (EO) for <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/restoring-common-sense-to-federal-procurement/" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external"> Restoring Common Sense to Federal Procurement </a> was signed, directing a comprehensive overhaul of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The stated goal of the EO is to simplify and streamline the FAR so that it includes only those provisions that are legally required or essential for efficient, secure, and cost-effective federal procurement. As a result, Part 39 of the FAR, which addresses Section 508 requirements in the acquisition of technology, has been streamlined.<br>

<div class="border-base radius-lg border-1px padding-1 bg-primary-lighter" style="margin-top: 1.0em;"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> A final rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation Overhaul is pending and will be updated here when formal notice is available. </p></div>

On June 11, 2025, a model deviation was issued by the GSA to implement a revision of text in FAR Part 39 in support of the EO named above.  Federal agencies are directed to follow the updated model deviation immediately, though the update will not be codified until the formal rulemaking process is completed.

## List of Amendments

While the FAR overhaul does include various language changes, the updates to the FAR with regards to Section 508 are largely structural in nature; meaning that some components were renumbered or moved to the Appendix. The following table compares the components and text of the previous FAR part with the components and text of the model deviation for FAR part 39.

In addition to various language changes, the FAR Model Deviation removed sections that were redundant or out of date. Some components, as indicated in the below Model Deviation, were moved to the Appendix or to the yet to be released Companion to the FAR.

                <p><strong>39.103</strong> Modular Contracting.<br>
                a) This section implements 41 U.S.C. 2308. Modular contracting is intended to reduce program risk and to incentivize contractor performance while meeting the Government's need for timely access to rapidly changing technology. Consistent with the agency's information technology architecture, agencies should, to the maximum extent practicable, use modular contracting to acquire major systems (see 2.101) of information technology. Agencies may also use modular contracting to acquire non-major systems of information technology.<br>
                b) When using modular contracting, an acquisition of a system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that— <br>
                    1) Are easier to manage individually than would be possible in one comprehensive acquisition;<br>
                    2) Address complex information technology objectives incrementally in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving workable systems or solutions for attainment of those objectives;<br>
                    3) Provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments, each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on any subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions;<bc>
                    4) Provide an opportunity for subsequent increments to take advantage of any evolution in technology or needs that occur during implementation and use of the earlier increments; and<br>
                    5) Reduce risk of potential adverse consequences on the overall project by isolating and avoiding custom-designed components of the system.
                c) The characteristics of an increment may vary depending upon the type of information technology being acquired and the nature of the system being developed. The following factors may be considered:<br>
                    1) To promote compatibility, the information technology acquired through modular contracting for each increment should comply with common or commercially acceptable information technology standards when available and appropriate, and shall conform to the agency's master information technology architecture.<br>
                    2) The performance requirements of each increment should be consistent with the performance requirements of the completed, overall system within which the information technology will function and should address interface requirements with succeeding increments.<br>
                d) For each increment, contracting officers shall choose an appropriate contracting technique that facilitates the acquisition of subsequent increments. Pursuant to parts 16 and 17 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, contracting officers shall select the contract type and method appropriate to the circumstances (e.g., indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, single contract with options, successive contracts, multiple awards, task order contracts). Contract(s) shall be structured to ensure that the Government is not required to procure additional increments. <br>
                e) To avoid obsolescence, a modular contract for information technology should, to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded within 180 days after the date on which the solicitation is issued. If award cannot be made within 180 days, agencies should consider cancellation of the solicitation in accordance with 48 CFR 14.209 or 15.206(e). To the maximum extent practicable, deliveries under the contract should be scheduled to occur within 18 months after issuance of the solicitation.Prescriptive instructions for establishing modular contracts</p></td>

<tr><td><p><strong>39.205</strong> Exemptions. <br>
    a) Allowable exemptions. An agency may grant an exemption for the following:<br>
        1) Undue burden. When an agency determines the acquisition of ICT conforming with all the applicable ICT accessibility standards would impose an undue burden on the agency, compliance with the ICT accessibility standards is only required to the extent that it would not impose an undue burden. In determining whether conformance to one or more ICT accessibility standards would impose an undue burden, an agency shall consider the extent to which conformance would impose significant difficulty or expense considering the agency resources available to the program or component for which the ICT supply or service is being procured. <br>
        2) Fundamental alteration. When an agency determines that acquisition of ICT that conforms with all applicable ICT accessibility standards would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT, such acquisition is required to conform only to the extent that conformance will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT. <br>
        3) Nonavailability of conforming commercial products and commercial services. Where there are no commercial products and commercial services that fully conform to the ICT accessibility standards, the agency shall procure the supplies or service available in the commercial marketplace that best meets the ICT accessibility standards consistent with the agency's needs. <br>
