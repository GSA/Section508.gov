To meet federal information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility requirements and ensure effective implementation of Section 508, it is essential for agencies to develop a structured training plan to educate their workforce on ICT accessibility. A well-designed training program helps staff understand their roles in complying with Section 508, reduces the risk of costly remediation, and supports consistent application of ICT standards across roles, content, systems, and procurement processes. By equipping employees with the necessary knowledge and skills, agencies streamline workflows, improve testing and evaluation practices, and ensure accessibility is integrated into every phase of digital product and service delivery.

This checklist covers seven key areas to guide considerations in the development or updating of a Section 508 training plan. These seven areas provide the foundation for educating the workforce on their roles and responsibilities with respect to ICT accessibility.

## Identify Governance and Section 508 Compliance Requirements and Responsibilities

This section focuses on establishing a clear understanding of applicable laws, agency strategic goals, and mission-based ICT to inform the foundational knowledge on which to educate employees.

## Document Policies and Procedures

The purpose of this planning section is to establish a formal, sustainable foundation for ICT accessibility training within the agency’s Section 508 program. Documenting policies and procedures ensures roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, training expectations are consistent and measurable, and compliance obligations are met. Integrating this policy into the broader agency governance framework promotes accountability, supports workforce readiness, and reinforces the agency’s long-term commitment to accessibility and inclusive technology practices.
