  How to Identify Policies That Should Incorporate ICT Accessibility
</h2>
The IT Accessibility Policy Framework provides guidance to agencies on how to evaluate internal policies to improve the integration of Section 508 requirements.<sup>1</sup> An agency may have hundreds of internal policies, including federal policies relevant to the agency, as well as policies that support the implementation of government-wide directives. This section describes how to identify policies at your agency that should incorporate references to ICT accessibility.<br>

<p id="policytype-list">
The IT Accessibility Policy Framework recommends focusing review on the following policy types, based on relevance to ICT accessibility. The following section, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/approach/">Guidance by Policy Type</a>, provides guidance on how to facilitate a policy review across each of the below policy types:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/acquisition-and-procurement/">Acquisition and Procurement</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/administrative-services/">Administrative Services</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/budget-and-finance/">Budget and Finance</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/communications/">Communications</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/emergency-response/">Emergency Response</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/human-resources-management/">Human Resources Management</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/information-technology-services/">Information Technology Services</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/legal/">Legal</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/real-property-management/">Real Property Management</a>
    </li>
</ul>
Similarly, the following ICT accessibility-related policies have been identified as foundational to Section 508 and should be in place within every agency. 
<ul>
    <li>ICT accessibility policy that ties accessibility to agency mission.</li>
    <li>Policy that establishes the Section 508 PM role and Section 508 Program.</li>
    <li>Policy that establishes methods or approaches for incorporating accessibility in ICT development processes, including Section 508 conformance validation.</li>
    <li>Policy that establishes Section 508/ICT accessibility in acquisitions and procurement. </li>
    <li>Policy that establishes Section 508 in content creation and publishing.</li>
    <li>Policy that establishes onboarding and annual ICT accessibility training.</li>
</ul>
Importantly, these foundational policies do not need to be standalone policies. Rather, they could be, and may already be, incorporated into other relevant policies at your agency.
<br>
The following policy types are not generally recommended for review as the corresponding subject matter may not have relevance to ICT accessibility.<sup>2</sup>

<ul>
    <li>Congressional Relations</li>
    <li>Federal Laws and Guidance</li>
</ul>

<br>
<a class="hover-large nolink" ><sup>2</sup>The IT Accessibility Policy Framework is intended to be used for remediation of<br> policies that apply to the internal functions of your agency. While it could also be<br> used to remediate policies that apply governmentwide, that is not its <br>intended purpose.</a>
