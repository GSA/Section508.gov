<h2 id="standards">
  Approach
</h2>
The ICT accessibility policy guidance that follows is organized by policy type and subtype. These policy types and subtypes emerged through a policy review conducted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Team and the Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF), an ongoing effort to create governmentwide business standards and assess agency needs for shared services.<sup>1</sup>

Each policy type is introduced with a description of the policy type. It is then expanded on in a table that:


<ul>
    <li>Lists policy subtypes associated with a given policy type.</li>
    <li>Describes these policy subtypes.</li>
    <li>Lists potential gaps in ICT accessibility language for the policy subtypes.</li>
    <li>Provides corresponding recommendations on the themes the ICT accessibility language should include for the policy subtypes.</li>
    <li>Provides recommended policy language that can be lifted verbatim or adapted with minimal changes into your agencyâ€™s policies. This language includes references to relevant law in the United States Code (U.S.C.) and the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), as well as relevant guidance and policy issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Unlike the rest of the document, references are embedded into the language rather than cited in footnotes to encourage direct usage.</li>
</ul>
<b>Thus, each potential gap leads to a recommendation, and each recommendation culminates in recommended policy language. </b>
<br>
<br>
While the potential gaps, recommended inclusions, and recommended policy language provided here represent the insights gained from the aforementioned policy review, they are not necessarily exhaustive. Footnotes throughout describe some policy subtypes may not be relevant for the IT Accessibility Policy Framework.
