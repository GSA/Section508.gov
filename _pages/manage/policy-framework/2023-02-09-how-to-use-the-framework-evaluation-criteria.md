  Description of Evaluation Criteria
</h2>
<h3 class = "subheading">
  Determination of Importance
</h3>
The IT Accessibility Policy Framework uses two criteria, <b>Sufficiency</b> and <b>Importance</b>, to evaluate agency policies for ICT accessibility language. These criteria, applied in combination across your agency’s policy directive, allow you to holistically determine which policies have the greatest need of remediation.
<h3 class = "subheading">
  Sufficiency
</h3>
The <b>Sufficiency</b> criteria is used to evaluate the adequacy of required Section 508 language within a given policy. A rating is assessed based on whether or not the policy is deficient with respect to the ICT accessibility requirements/information that you would expect in that document. To determine the <b>Sufficiency</b> rating for a given policy, consider searching for ICT accessibility keywords, assessing its scope, and identifying the paragraph(s) that contain ICT accessibility language.

<ul>
<li><b>Fully Sufficient</b>: Contains all relevant ICT accessibility requirements.</li>
<li><b>Mostly Sufficient</b>: Contains most ICT accessibility requirements; missing minor, non-critical accessibility elements.</li>
<li><b>Somewhat Sufficient</b>: Generally has some ICT accessibility language; missing a few critical elements or several non-critical ICT accessibility elements.</li>
<li><b>Inadequate, Contains Some ICT Accessibility Language</b>: Has limited ICT accessibility language; missing several vital ICT accessibility elements/requirements.</li>
<li><b>Essential Accessibility Information Missing</b>: Fully insufficient, missing most/all ICT accessibility language; missing most/all critical ICT accessibility-related requirements or language.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "subheading">
  Importance
</h3>
<b>Importance</b> is a composite of two criteria, <b>Relevance</b> and <b>Level of Detail</b>, which are described below. The determination of overall <b>Importance</b> with respect to accessibility considerations based on ratings from these two sub-criteria is then summarized.

<h3 class = "subheading">
  Relevance
</h3>
The <b>Relevance</b> criteria is used to evaluate the alignment of subject matter to ICT accessibility. A rating is given to a policy to determine its importance to ICT accessibility.

<ul>
  <li><b>Highly Relevant</b>: Policy is fully related to ICT accessibility considerations or is an ICT accessibility policy in and of itself.</li>
  <li><b>Relevant</b>: ICT accessibility is integral to the execution or definition of this policy; policy should include multiple ICT accessibility requirements/considerations.</li>
  <li><b>Somewhat Relevant</b>: ICT accessibility is somewhat important to the execution or definition of this policy; policy should include several ICT accessibility requirements.</li>
  <li><b>Not Very Relevant</b>: ICT accessibility is tangentially related to this policy; policy requires a few ICT accessibility requirements.</li>
  <li><b>Not Relevant</b>: Policy is not related to ICT accessibility; no ICT accessibility requirements should or need to be included in the policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "subheading">
  Level of Detail
</h3>
The <b>Level of Detail</b> criteria is used to classify the type of a policy and its intended use (i.e., strategic vs. tactical).
<ul>
  <li><b>Organizational Purpose/Governing Guidelines</b>: Policy is an overarching governance document for the agency that mostly specifies the need for creation of additional policies, rules and/or directives (Strategic Level Document).</li>
  <li><b>Office Rules, Policy, and Directive</b>: Primary documents that define goals and high level ways of working (Operational Level Document).</li>
  <li><b>Operational Guidance/Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</b>: Tactical level documents that generally provide specific instructions to execute tasks (Tactical Level Document).</li>
</ul>

<h3 class = "subheading">
  Determination of Importance
</h3>
Determination of Importance
The <b>Importance</b> rating can be determined by interpreting and combining the ratings for <b>Relevance</b> and <b>Level of Detail</b>. On the next page, <b>Table 1</b> illustrates this approach through an exhaustive list of conditional statements, in which ratings for <b>Relevance</b> and <b>Level of Detail</b> serve as the conditions (i.e., the “if” part of the statement) and the <b>Importance</b> ratings serve as the outcomes (i.e. the “then” part of the statement). Note that <b>Table 1</b> is sorted first by <b>Importance</b>, then by <b>Relevance</b>, and last by <b>Level of Detail</b>.
