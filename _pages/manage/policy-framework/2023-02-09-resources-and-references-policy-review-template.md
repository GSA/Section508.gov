  Policy Review Template
</h2>
The <a href="https://assets.section508.gov/assets/files/Policy+Review+Template.xlsx" download="Policy Review Template.xlsx">Policy Review Template</a> is intended to facilitate your agencyâ€™s policy review according to the criteria established in the IT Accessibility Policy Framework. To help harmonize the variety of ways agencies organize their policy directives, the template provides agencies with columns to select policy types and subtypes as described in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/guidance-by-policy-type/approach/">Guidance by Policy Type</a>, and map those selections to its own internal categories. The centerpiece of the template, the Policy Review Tracker sheet, has four hundred rows that are prepared for policy review. Before using the Policy Review Tracker sheet, you are encouraged to review the README sheet to understand the purpose of each column. Furthermore, the Counts sheet tallies the number of policies according to policy type, subtype, and ICT Accessibility Policy Need.
