  Section 508 Program Maturity Reporting
</h2>
<p dir="ltr">
  Federal agencies are required to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) twice per year on their IT accessibility/Section 508 program maturity and effectiveness. The CIO Council’s Accessibility Community of Practice and GSA analyze these reports to find ways to improve collaboration across agencies, reduce redundancies, and develop solutions to improve the management of government accessibility programs.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    <strong>Who needs to submit a report?</strong><br /> Reports are required from all <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/glossary#agency">CFO Act Agencies</a>, and recommended for all federal agencies.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  <strong>When is the report due?</strong><br /> Reports are due twice per year, in February and August. The next report is due by 5:00 PM ET on February 14, 2022.
