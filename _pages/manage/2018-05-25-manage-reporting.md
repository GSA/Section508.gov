The [OMB Strategic Plan for Improving Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/strategic-plan-508-compliance.pdf) aims to improve how agencies manage Section 508 and IT accessibility responsibilities by increasing transparency, strengthening accountability, and improving collaboration.

## Section 508 Program Maturity Reporting
Federal agencies are required to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) twice per year on their IT accessibility/Section 508 program maturity and effectiveness. The CIO Council’s Accessibility Community of Practice and GSA analyze these reports to find ways to improve collaboration across agencies, reduce redundancies, and develop solutions to improve the management of government accessibility programs.

### Who needs to submit a report?
Reports are required from all [CFO Act Agencies]({{site.baseurl}}/content/glossary#agency), and recommended for all federal agencies.

### When is the report due?
Reports are due twice per year, in February and August. The next report is due by 5:00 PM ET on August 15, 2023 with final snapshots due by 5:00 PM ET on August 31, 2013.

### Is there a new reporting system for this year?
No. GSA launched an online reporting system in early 2019, which agencies will continue to use going forward.

### How do I gain access to the online reporting system?
- CFO Act agencies: A month before the reporting due date, GSA will send data submission information to each agency Section 508 Program Manager
- Non-CFO Act agencies: A month before the reporting due date, GSA will send data submission information to Section 508 Program Managers with agencies who have previously reported
- Other federal agencies that wish to submit a report should email us at <a class="mailto" href="mailto:section.508@gsa.gov">section.508@gsa.gov</a> to request access to the reporting system

### How do I prepare the report?
- Complete the Mandatory 508 Program Maturity Metrics section for each of the five reporting requirements
- Complete the Website Compliance Metric per your existing testing processes

### Is the PMR the same as the Annual Section 508 Assessment?
No, they are two different reports. The semi-annual Section 508 Program Maturity Report is required by OMB, while the [Annual Section 508 Assessment](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/) is required by Congress under Section 752 of the [Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF#page=651).
