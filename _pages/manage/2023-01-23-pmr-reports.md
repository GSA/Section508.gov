The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) [Strategic Plan for Improving Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/strategic-plan-508-compliance.pdf) aims to improve how agencies manage Section 508 and IT accessibility responsibilities by increasing transparency, strengthening accountability, and improving collaboration.

Federal agencies have been required to report to OMB twice per year on their Section 508 program maturity and effectiveness. GSA's Government-wide IT Accessibility Program analyzes these reports to identify ways to increase collaboration across agencies, reduce redundancies, and develop solutions to improve the management of government accessibility programs. Executive summary reports, along with a companion supplemental report, are provided to OMB, U.S. Access Board, and Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP).

In a [letter to GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan regarding Section 508 compliance](https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_gsa_administrator_robin_carnahan_re_section_508_compliance.pdf), members of the Special Committee on Aging, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions requested that GSA provide all summary reports, trend analysis, or other analyses or recommendations from 2019 through 2022.

Accordingly, and in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council, GSA is making these Section 508 Program Maturity Reports available for download on this page.
