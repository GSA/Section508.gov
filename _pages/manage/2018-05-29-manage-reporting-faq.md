<span>These are the most often-asked questions about the OMB 508/IT Accessibility Maturity Assessment reporting process. If you have a question that is not answered here, please send your question to </span>[<span>feedback@cio.gov</span>][1]<span>.</span>

## **The Questions**

[What are the reporting requirements?][2] 

[Who is required to complete an assessment?][3] 

[How will the information be used?][4]

[How should scores be calculated?][5] 

[What testing methodologies should be used?][6]

[How should contractor Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) be estimated?][7] 

[What if the agency can&rsquo;t provide all the data?][8] 

<h3 id="reporting requirements">
  <strong>What are the reporting requirements?</strong>
</h3>

<span>Per the </span>[<span>OMB Strategic Plan for Improving Management of Section 508</span>][9]<span>, agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs), in consultation with the Chief Acquisition Officers (CAOs), must:</span>

  * <span>Develop a plan for completing a baseline assessment of the agency&rsquo;s IT Accessibility/Section 508 program based on the reporting requirements, and submit their plan to the CIO Council at </span><span>feedback@cio.gov</span> <span>by November 30, 2013.</span>
  * <span>Complete the initial assessment and submit to the CIO Council at </span><span>feedback@cio.gov</span> <span>by December 30, 2013, then complete ongoing assessments every 6 months thereafter.</span>

<h3 id="complete Section 508 assessment">
  <strong>Who is required to complete an assessment?</strong>
</h3>

<span>Reporting is </span>_<span>required</span>_ <span>for Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies; however, all federal agencies are encouraged to submit a Section 508 assessment. Contact us at </span>[<span>Section.508@gsa.gov</span>][10] <span>to request a link to the reporting tool. </span>

<h3 id="information submitted">
  <strong>How will the information be used?</strong>
</h3>

<span>The CIO Council&rsquo;s Accessibility Community of Practice and the General Services Administration use the information for cross-agency analysis, trending, and planning. The goal is to improve collaboration across agencies, reduce redundancies, and develop solutions and recommendations that improve Section 508 management across the federal government.</span>

<h3 id="measure percentages">
  <strong>How should scores be calculated?</strong>
</h3>

<span>Depending on how the agency records Section 508 testing results, the percentage measure can be calculated either:</span>

  * <span>As a percentage of applicable 508 standards supported vs. not supported for all technology tested within the category; or</span>
  * <span>As a percentage of technology products which fully support vs. do not fully support the applicable 508 standards for all technology tested within the category (i.e., pass/fail).</span>

<span>Each agency has the flexibility to select a sample size they feel they can measure in a meaningful way. </span>

<h3 id="testing methodologies">
  <strong>What testing methodologies should be used?</strong>
</h3>

<span>There is no requirement for a specific testing methodology at this time, &nbsp;but the Accessibility Community of Practice encourages the use of robust and repeatable testing procedures such as the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/test/trusted-tester">Trusted Tester Program</a>. Each agency should perform testing per their current processes and procedures and report accordingly.</span>

<h3 id="FTEs">
  <strong>How should contractor Full Time Equivalents (FTEs) be estimated?</strong>
</h3>

<span>In cases where you are not able to ascertain the number of contractors or contractor hours being spent on accessibility, you should estimate. First, determine the percentage of 508 work being performed on the contract, then apply this percentage to the total cost of the contract, and divide that dollar value by the average cost of each FTE.</span>

<h3 id="if not provided">
  <strong>What if the agency can&rsquo;t provide all the data?</strong>
</h3>

<span>The default assumption for missing data, or null values, is zero. In other words, if you do not provide a number of FTEs, a number of items tested, or a pass rate percentage, the default assumption in any data analysis will be zero. Please enter zero whenever zero represents the true value.</span>
