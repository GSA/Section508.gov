## [Minnesota][21]  
_STAR Program Accessible Technology Bill_ Governor Pawlenty signed the accessible technology bill on May 22, 2009. This new law requires the state to adopt Section 508 standards and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) to develop and maintain accessible statewide information and telecommunications technology systems and services.

## [Missouri][22]  
_Assistive Technology Information Technology Access: Questions, Answers, and Unknowns for State and Local Entities_ Missouri state law (RSMo. 191.863) requires state agencies to develop and procure accessible information technology unless an undue burden would be imposed. The statute defines state agencies as "each department, office, board, bureau, commission or other unit of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of state government, including public four-year and two-year colleges and universities." Missouri's law defines information technology the same as Section 508. The statute also charges the Missouri assistive technology council (MoAT) and the office of information technology (OIT) with responsibility for adopting standards to be used by state agencies in the procurement or development of accessible information technology.

## [New York][23]  
_NY State and section 508_ New York State has had a web accessibility policy since September of 1999. That first policy was aligned with the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, current version (WCAG). When the guidelines were reformulated, and the "last call" draft was published in 2004, the IT Accessibility Committee advised that the successor WCAG guidelines were practically speaking, unimplementable. In reaction to this, OFT (with advice from the Committee) developed a set of hybrid standards that melded the WCAG and U. S. Section 508, which covered all federal agencies and contractors doing business with the federal government.

## [Oklahoma][24]  
_EITA" Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Law_ In 2004, the Oklahoma Legislature passed Oklahoma law modeling Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

The law pertains to state agencies, post-secondary institutions, and the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education system. House Bill 2015 (7.1.09) created the position of Chief Information Officer and reflects new section numbers for Oklahoma's 508 law. Oklahoma Statute: Title 62: Section 34.28 (was 41.5t), Section 34.29 (was 41.5t.1) and Section 34.30 (was 41.5t.2).

Realizing in 2004 that accessible technologies serve all users regardless of their ability, the Virginia General Assembly and the Governor of Virginia enacted supporting state legislation.

In support of the legislation VITA implemented the Virginia Information Technology Accessibility Standard. The standard is incorporated in Virginia's Enterprise Architecture and designated as Information Technology Resource Management (ITRM) Standard GOV103-00.
