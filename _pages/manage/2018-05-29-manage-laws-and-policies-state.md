Section 508 applies to the Federal government but there may be implications for employees and others at the State level. Many states have also passed legislation requiring Electronic and Information technology (EIT) also know as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility. Here are a number of resources and links that may help you to see which states have published laws and or policies on developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology. Your state not listed? [Send us][1] your policy or site information and we'll display it here.

[**Alabama**][12]{:name='anchorName'} _Accessibility Policy_ In response to the need to ensure equal access to electronic and information technologies, the state of Alabama has developed a set of standards for Web page design. Just as environmental obstacles have inhibited individuals with disabilities, the Web poses an entirely new set of obstacles. In recognition of those individuals with visual, physical or developmental disabilities alabama.gov has adopted a policy to make government information accessible to all.

[**Arizona**][13]  
_AZ.gov - Assessment and Evaluation_

[**California**][14]  
_State University Accessible Technology Initiative_  
Automated evaluation tools only check things that can be evaluated by a computer. These definitely do not include the human factors that are contained here. Even looking at human factors cannot guarantee accessibility for every possible user, but following this procedure will certainly represent a good-faith effort to make a page or site as accessibile as possible today.

[**Illinois**][17] The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) requires Illinois agencies and universities to ensure that their web sites, systems, and other information technologies are accessible to people with disabilities. While the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require the State to address accessibility in general, the IITAA requires the State to establish and follow specific, functional accessibility standards and to address accessibility proactively.

[**Minnesota**][21] _STAR Program Accessible Technology Bill_ Governor Pawlenty signed the accessible technology bill on May 22, 2009. This new law requires the state to adopt Section 508 standards and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) to develop and maintain accessible statewide information and telecommunications technology systems and services.

[**Missouri**][22] _Assistive Technology Information Technology Access: Questions, Answers, and Unknowns for State and Local Entities_ Missouri state law (RSMo. 191.863) requires state agencies to develop and procure accessible information technology unless an undue burden would be imposed. The statute defines state agencies as "each department, office, board, bureau, commission or other unit of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of state government, including public four-year and two-year colleges and universities." Missouri's law defines information technology the same as Section 508. The statute also charges the Missouri assistive technology council (MoAT) and the office of information technology (OIT) with responsibility for adopting standards to be used by state agencies in the procurement or development of accessible information technology.

[**New York**][23] _NY State and section 508_ New York State has had a web accessibility policy since September of 1999. That first policy was aligned with the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, current version (WCAG). When the guidelines were reformulated, and the "last call" draft was published in 2004, the IT Accessibility Committee advised that the successor WCAG guidelines were practically speaking, unimplementable. In reaction to this, OFT (with advice from the Committee) developed a set of hybrid standards that melded the WCAG and U. S. Section 508, which covered all federal agencies and contractors doing business with the federal government.

[**Oklahoma**][24] _EITA" Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Law_ In 2004, the Oklahoma Legislature passed Oklahoma law modeling Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Governor Brad Henry signed HB 2197 into law April 2004 thus improving the accessibility of electronic and information technology (EIT). The law pertains to state agencies, post-secondary institutions, and the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education system. House Bill 2015 (7.1.09) created the position of Chief Information Officer and reflects new section numbers for Oklahoma's 508 law. Oklahoma Statute: Title 62: Section 34.28 (was 41.5t), Section 34.29 (was 41.5t.1) and Section 34.30 (was 41.5t.2).

[**Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA)**][25] Realizing in 2004 that accessible technologies serve all users regardless of their ability, the Virginia General Assembly and the Governor of Virginia enacted supporting state legislation. By state Code, all Virginia state executive branch agencies and institutions of higher education now are required to comply with the regulations that implement the electronic and information technology accessibility standards of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and any regulations as may be prescribed by Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA). In support of the legislation VITA implemented the Virginia Information Technology Accessibility Standard. The standard is incorporated in Virginia's Enterprise Architecture and designated as Information Technology Resource Management (ITRM) Standard GOV103-00.
