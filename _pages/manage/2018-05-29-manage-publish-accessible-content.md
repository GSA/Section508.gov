These tips will help your agency publish content in an accessible way.

  * It all starts with content creation. Review the [guidance on how to create accessible content][1], to create content that builds in accessibility from the start.
  * When publishing electronic content that does not fully support the Revised 508 Standards, provide information on how to access the content via an alternative means.

  * When the electronic content is posted to social media, consider:
  * Learning how to use social media platforms to publish accessible content. For example, when posting a video to YouTube, follow YouTube protocols for uploading captions.
  * Where it is not possible to publish accessible social media content, publish a duplicate but accessible version of the content on an agency website or through some other means. Where possible, note in the social media post where users can find the accessible version.

  * When your agency provides software to view content, ensure the software is also compliant with the [Revised 508 Standards.][2]
