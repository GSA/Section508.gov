title: 'Implementing a Public Feedback Mechanism'
---

In order to successfully implement a feedback mechanism to collect, track, and resolve digital accessibility issues, the following is recommended for agencies:

<ol>
    <li>Scope the type of public feedback (as opposed to an <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title29/html/USCODE-2021-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm" target="_blank">Administrative Complaint</a> under Section 508) the mechanism will collect. Agencies are encouraged to clearly define what constitutes public feedback regarding accessibility issues <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/" target="_blank">"with agency websites and digital services"</a> and include the definition in their policy and on their public websites, where applicable.  Some examples of public feedback are a user emailing stating they cannot navigate a webpage or complete a process using specific Assistive Technology, a user may provide feedback that color contrast is not sufficient on a web page, or that a digital form is not accessible to them.
        <ol type="a">
            <li>In the <a href="https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionP" target="_blank">Governmentwide Assessment</a> a public feedback response is defined as "The agency's standard feedback mechanism provides the ability for website visitors to provide comments and/or feedback Submissions under this feedback mechanism do not inherently count as a Complaint but are considered a public feedback response.</li>
            <li>Feedback on accessibility is not solely limited to web content; it also includes digital services. This could be an electronic document, a kiosk, etc.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Institute a public feedback mechanism that:
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Is Section 508 conformant (including a fully conformant webpage from which the feedback mechanism is located);</li>
            <li>Is included in applicable agency Section 508 policy(ies);</li>
            <li>Provides instructions on what data is to be collected and communication expectations throughout the resolution timeline;</li>
            <li>Is available and easy to find within the agency website's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/laws-and-policies/website-accessibility-statement/">accessibility statement</a>; and</li>
            <li>Facilitates collecting, tracking, and adjudicating the feedback received.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

There are two primary feedback mechanisms implemented across government: email address and an online (web-based) form. The tables below outline considerations for agencies in determining what will be more effectively implemented in their environment.

**Note**: Agencies may choose to include a phone number as an additional method to provide feedback, but only do so if the phone is monitored during business hours and someone is available to intake the verbal information accurately.

## Feedback Mechanism

Feedback mechanisms may allow:

-   Preformatted, structured data to be ported to a tracking mechanism (either via intake linked to a ticketing system or via use of email export to excel).
-   Users to submit feedback "anonymously", either with a fake email or using a fake name.

### Email Address:

The email address provided may be a generic inbox that is monitored by the Section 508 program.

Several examples of email address implementation and supplemental instructions: 

-   <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/508_overview.html" target="_blank">Social Security Administration</a>
-   <a href="https://www.va.gov/accessibility-at-va/#what-to-do-if-you-find-an-acce" target="_blank">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>
-   <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/accessibility" target="_blank">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission </a>
-   <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/accessibility" target="_blank">Department of Homeland Security</a>
-   <a href="https://www.usda.gov/accessibility-statement" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>
-   <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/accessibility-statement" target="_blank">General Services Administration</a>
-   <a href="https://www.doi.gov/accessibility" target="_blank">Department of the Interior</a>
-   <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/about/policy/accessibility.html" target="_blank">The U.S. Access Board</a>
-   <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/aboutdol/accessibility" target="_blank">Department of Labor</a>
-   <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/about/policies/accessibility" target="_blank">Accessibility policy | U.S. Department of Commerce</a>
-   <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/accessibility" target="_blank">U.S. EEOC Accessibility Statement | U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>

Considerations:

-   Email is regarded as being accessible
-   Allows for more free-form content for the submitter to explain the issue in their own words (agency should still include instructions for minimum data requested)
-   Easy to swap email address or instructions when needs change
-   Easy/low barrier for users to provide feedback
-   Inexpensive and easy to implement, especially for small agencies
-   Outlook emails can be imported to Excel: [How to Import Emails from Outlook to Excel with Power Query](https://www.xelplus.com/import-outlook-to-excel-with-power-query/) for a tracking tool
-   Possible higher level of effort to input data into tracking mechanism on back end; may not be suitable for high volume of feedback (depending on agency resourcing)
-   May not get all the information needed, requiring contacting requestor to complete intake
-   Users may want slightly more direction with the information they need to provide compared to associated on-page text instructions
-   Automatic receipt of submission may be possible but also lends to doubt as to if a person reviewed the email
-   High likelihood of receiving junk email
-   Submitter may have difficulty following up to check on status or resolution without an automated ticket number

### Online web-based Form 

Several examples of an online form implementation and instructions:

-   [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/other/accessibility.html)
-   [Department of Defense](https://dodcio.defense.gov/DoDSection508/Section-508-Form/)

Considerations:

-   Users clearly know what data is being requested and what is required
-   Provides immediate confirmation of submission
-   Potential for end-user to independently track resolution status (depending on tracking system implementation)
-   May be able to provide an automatic ticket number to submitter for tracking (depending on agency implementation)
-   Captcha can be used to minimize bot entries but must be Section 508 conformant
-   Provides option to be fully anonymous, possibly resulting in fake submissions
-   Requires a tracking system to realize efficiencies
-   Must ensure accessibility of online form
-   If the form asks for more information than the submitter knows or wants to provide, they may not submit

### Phone number:

Agencies may choose to include a phone number as an additional method to provide feedback, but only do so if the phone is monitored during business hours and someone is available to intake the verbal information accurately.

<ol type="1">
    <li>At a minimum, the feedback mechanism should request the following data from the submitter and send the user confirmation of submission (see step 4 for additional information regarding expectations of communications):
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Point of contact name (optional)</li>
            <li>Point of contact email address (optional)</li>
            <li>Point of contact Phone number (optional)</li>
            <li>URL or description of where the issue is located (use this as an example of what the submitter can put; but this is should be optional)
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Since digital services may be more than just a URL, consider other prompts to best understand the location of the accessibility issue</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>A description of the problem(s) encountered <strong>(required)</strong>:</li>
    <li>Consider(optional):
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Asking the submitter to include the preferred format in which they want to receive any materials, or</li>
            <li>Asking the submitter for the best method of contact (email, phone, etc.)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

**Example language for email mechanism implementation**: If you believe that any websites or digital services that have accessibility problems or you'd like to provide general accessibility feedback, you may make an inquiry or ask for help by emailing _[insert email address]_. We will confirm receipt of your inquiry within 2 business days and communicate throughout the process as we work to resolve your accessibility issue.

To ensure we respond in a manner most helpful to you, please include in your email:

1.  a description of your accessibility problem (include any information that will help us replicate the problem, such as browser, assistive technology, operating system)
2.  the web address (URL) of the material with which you are having difficulty or specify the location of the issue if a URL cannot be provided,
3.  your contact information (such as name), and
4.  if you'd like to receive communications regarding your issue.

## Feedback Tracking and Reporting

<ol type="1">
    <li>Agencies should have a tracking method for public accessibility feedback received. At a minimum, agencies should:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Be able to perform ticket intake, assign a reference ID, and assign the ticket to the responsible party for resolution.
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>This may be via an application or other ticketing system used within the agency, but may also include utilizing a spreadsheet or equivalent to assign tasking and track (especially for smaller agencies)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Clearly define roles and responsibilities:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Define who is responsible for initial ticket input and who is responsible to route accessibility feedback appropriately (e.g., to the product owner, to a vendor (Assistive Technology vendor, application vendor, etc.), or determine it is a user error).
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>It is recommended that the Section 508 program is the point of contact to input/route accessibility feedback appropriately. However, other parties within the agency may have sufficient knowledge to be able to route feedback appropriately; each agency should determine the most appropriate and knowledgeable responsible party.</li>
                    <li>At a minimum, the agency Section 508 program should be consulted as an advisor in arbitration of accessibility feedback.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Define who will track submission progress, closure, etc.</li>
            <li>Define what the definition of "done" is, so that each responsible party for adjudicating the feedback to resolution understands expectations:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Onus on resolution within each agency will vary by responsible party (e.g., most likely will not be the Section 508 program)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Set expectations for communication with the submitter. Considerations include:
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Within how many business days should the agency confirm receipt of the submitter's feedback and provide a reference ID for tracking? It is recommended that agencies confirm receipt within 1-2 business days.</li>
                    <li>Is there a template confirmation email that can be used?</li>
                    <li>Can the intake system automatically generate a confirmation email with a reference ID?</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>How frequently should the responsible party communicate with the submitter during adjudication?
                <ol>
                    <li>Only as needed?</li>
                    <li>At minimum, a touchpoint once a month?</li>
                    <li>Only upon resolution?</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Require communication back to the submitter regarding the resolution or response of action to ensure their concerns are addressed.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For each feedback submission, track, at a minimum:
        <ol type="i">
            <li>All information that was submitted in initial intake including date submitted,</li>
            <li>Any communication with the submitter to further understand the accessibility issue(s),</li>
            <li>Notes pertinent to resolution (e.g., defect number, defect logged with external vendor, internal or external communications, etc.)</li>
            <li>ICT type, e.g., website, document, audio/video, software, hardware,  kiosk, etc.</li>
            <li>Strongly consider tracking defects by Section 508/WCAG standard for awareness and re-training, and performance management</li>
            <li>Documentation of final resolution (summary), and</li>
            <li>Date of final resolution.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Consider regular reporting of metrics on public feedback to establish a baseline, generate benchmarks, inform technical assistance and training opportunities, and target policy updates</li>
</ol>
