This could be a bureau, office, component, or at the department level (e.g., headquarters). Agency is not strictly used within the assessment to mean the sole organization responsible for a certain area of administration. For example, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both Headquarters of DHS and Customs and Border Protection are considered agencies.

- <span id="alternative-means-plan"><strong>Alternative Means Plan:</strong></span> Documentation that establishes a framework and outlines the strategies for meeting the access needs of people with disabilities until the identified Section 508 compliance defect(s) are remediated.

An [Administrative Complaint](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title29/html/USCODE-2021-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm) is a formal complaint made by "any individual with a disability...alleging that a Federal department or agency fails to comply with subsection (a)(1) in providing electronic and information technology" ([§794d. Electronic and information technology (f)(1)(A)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title29/html/USCODE-2021-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm)) [i.e., fails to provide accessible ICT]. Administrative complaints are "filed with the Federal department or agency alleged to be in non-compliance. The Federal department or agency receiving the complaint shall apply the complaint procedures established to implement section 794 of this title for resolving allegations of discrimination in a federally conducted program or activity." ([§794d. Electronic and information technology (f)(2)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2021-title29/html/USCODE-2021-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d.htm)). Lawsuits and civil actions are other types of complaints. Agencies may utilize their internal Section 504/501 complaints process and may need to coordinate with other agency personnel to fully gather this information ([DOJ Civil Rights Division iii. Administrative Complaints](https://www.justice.gov/crt/iii-administrative-complaints)). 

  Complaints differ from public feedback responses that your agency receives through the mechanism provided to meet the [OMB 2013 Strategic Plan for Improving Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/strategic-plan-508-compliance.pdf). Public feedback responses could escalate to a complaint, but submission of feedback is not inherently considered a complaint. 

- <span id="conformant"><strong>Conform (also Conformance/Conformant):</strong></span> See [Fully Conform](#fully-conform). 

- <span id="contractor"><strong>Contractor:</strong></span> A person who enters into a contract with any agency or department of the United States government and is paid for services, material, equipment, and/or supplies.

With respect to accessibility of information and communications technology, contractors may perform services such as testing, remediation, development, training, or other program services as needed. 

- <span id="coordinator"><strong>Coordinator (also Section 508 Coordinator):</strong></span> See [Section 508 Program Manager](#section-508-program-manager). 

<h2>
  <span id="sectionD">D</span>
</h2>

- <span id="deploying"><strong>Deploying:</strong></span> Bring into effective action; utilize, publish, or distribute.

- <span id="digital-content"><strong>Digital Content:</strong></span> Overarching term to include all forms of electronic ICT, such as: multimedia, electronic documents, PDFs, social media, web content, etc. See also [Electronic Content](#electronic-content).

- <span id="dimension"><strong>Dimension:</strong></span> An aspect or category on which an agency's accessibility maturity is measured.

- <span id="document:"><strong>Document:</strong></span> While not the technical definition of "document", for these questions the term "document" is used to refer to information created by word processing and other authoring tools commonly used to share information including, but not limited to,  Microsoft Word (DOCX), PowerPoint (PPTX), Excel (XLSX), and Portable Document Format (PDF). 

<h2>
  <span id="sectionE">E</span>
</h2>

- <span id="e-gov-line-of-business"><strong>e-gov line of business:</strong></span> An e-government line of business (e-gov LoB) is defined as an intra-agency shared service, a line of business, or a multi-agency collaboration established by the Office of Management and Budget under M-04-08.

- <span id="electronic-content"><strong>Electronic Content:</strong></span> Electronic information and data, as well as the encoding that defines its structure, presentation, and interactions (see [36 CFR 1194, E103](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E103-definitions)), including Electronic Content  that is public facing or Agency Official Communication that is not public facing; as defined by [E205 of the Section 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E205-content). 

<h2>
  <span id="sectionF">F</span>
</h2>

- <span id="feedback-loop"><strong>Feedback loop:</strong></span> A process of receiving feedback from stakeholders and responding by incorporating that feedback into processes, policies, and procedures for refinement. 

- <span id="formal"><strong>Formal:</strong></span> Officially sanctioned or recognized.

- <span id="frequency"><strong>Frequency:</strong></span> Several places throughout the assessment criteria use the following frequency scale: 
    - Never: 0%
    - Sometimes/Some: Activities that are performed approximately 1%-24% of the time.
    - Regularly: Activities that are performed approximately 25%-59% of the time.
    - Frequently: Activities that are performed approximately 60%-89% of the time.
    - Almost always: Activities that are performed approximately 90% or more of the time.

    **NOTE** that the scale of frequency is not an evenly distributed linear scale.

    A specific range is provided for each response (e.g., "25% to 59%"); it is not expected that your agency tracks the exact percentage for every item in the assessment (e.g., "Yes, my agency does XYZ 59.75% of the time, so that's 'Frequently'"). Your agency can make an estimate based on your agency's collective experience (e.g., "Yes, my agency does XYZ more than half the time – maybe even a bit more than half of the time. I think this is something my agency does 'Frequently'").

    **Subjectivity and Interpretation**

    Many of the question responses contain multiple items which may be difficult to assess as individual elements. For example, one of the responses for Question 55 is:

    "d) Contract deliverables that are required to be Section 508 conformant are frequently verified prior to acceptance, including required remediation when necessary."

    There are two parts to this response option: verification, and remediation. Are both items done 'Frequently'? Is verification 'frequent' and remediation is 'almost always'? There may be cases where there is not an exact answer, but please provide your agency’s best estimation of what happens in practice.

    **Agency Goals versus Practice**

    Please select the most appropriate response for what happens in practice at your agency. For example, one of the responses for Question 46 is:

    "c) Agency requires a standard Section 508 conformance validation test process in formal policy and web content testers regularly follow the required test process.”

    If it is true that your agency includes this requirement in formal policy, but in actual practice web content testers sometimes follow the required test process, please select the response that aligns with your agency practice rather than the requirement. In this situation, your agency response will be b) (Sometimes) rather than c) (Regularly) because the former more accurately reflects day to day activities.

- <span id="frequently"><strong>Frequently:</strong></span> Activities that are performed 60%-89% of the time.

- <span id="full-time-equivalent"><strong>FTE or Full-time Equivalent:</strong></span> The total number of regular straight-time hours worked (i.e., not including overtime or holiday hours worked) by employees divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. Annual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off and other approved leave categories are considered "hours worked" for purposes of defining full-time equivalent employment that is reported. 

- <span id="fully-conform"><strong>Fully conform:</strong></span> For any ICT product to be conformant, the entire ICT product must meet all applicable Section 508 standards. For example, for a web page to fully conform to Section 508, the entire web page must meet all applicable 38 WCAG Level A and AA Success Criteria.
