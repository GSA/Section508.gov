Section 508 applies to the Federal government but there may be implications for employees and others at the State level. Many states have also passed legislation requiring Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility in addition to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-publish-final-rule-strengthen-web-and-mobile-app-access-people" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">rules introduced in 2024 by the Department of Justice under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a> to strengthen web and mobile app access for people with disabilities. 

The information on this page offers a number of resources that may help you to see which states have published laws and or policies on developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology. 

If your state is not listed, please [contact us][27] using your government email and share your policy and website information to be displayed here. If you are a State, Local, Territorial, or Tribal government employee, you are welcome to join the [Section 508 IT Accessibility Community][28].

The statute defines state agencies as "each department, office, board, bureau, commission or other unit of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of state government, including public four-year and two-year colleges and universities." Missouri's law defines information technology the same as Section 508. The statute also charges the Missouri assistive technology council (MoAT) and the office of information technology (OIT) with responsibility for adopting standards to be used by state agencies in the procurement or development of accessible information technology.

## New York
<a href="https://its.ny.gov/document/accessibility-web-based-information-and-applications-compliance-reporting" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">New York Office of Technology Services</a> New York State has had a web accessibility policy since September of 1999. That first policy was aligned with the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, current version (WCAG). When the guidelines were reformulated, and the "last call" draft was published in 2004, the IT Accessibility Committee advised that the successor WCAG guidelines were practically speaking, unimplementable. In reaction to this, OFT (with advice from the Committee) developed a set of hybrid standards that melded the WCAG and U. S. Section 508, which covered all federal agencies and contractors doing business with the federal government.

The standard is incorporated in Virginia's Enterprise Architecture and designated as Information Technology Resource Management (ITRM) Standard GOV103-00.

## Washington
<a href="https://watech.wa.gov/policies/digital-accessibility-policy" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Washington State's Digital Accessibility Policy</a> and <a href="https://watech.wa.gov/policies/digital-accessibility-standard"  target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Digital Accessibility Standard</a> require state agencies to ensure that individuals with disabilities have access to and can use information and data, allowing them the same services and content available to those without disabilities, unless there are technical or legal limitations.
