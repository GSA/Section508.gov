title: Section 508 Program Team Roles and Responsibilities
created: 2025-08-11
---

Section 508 program managers (PM) collaborate with various teams committed to and responsible for ensuring their [important role in their agency's overall Section 508 compliance efforts.](https://www.section508.gov/manage/roles/#management) To achieve success, a Section 508 Program Office must be integrated throughout the entire agency. The Section 508 Program Office should function as a support service, assisting various groups, teams, and divisions within the agency in meeting their digital accessibility goals and obligations. Each of these groups have their own responsibilities for implementing Section 508 policy in the organization. The goal of this document is to outline the scope of each of these functions and to provide guidance on what collaboration might look like between your Section 508 Program Office and stakeholders across IT, procurement, acquisition, human capital, contracting, and customer experience.

As you consider how the Section 508 Program Office is integrated into your organization, note that the landscape for Section 508 Program stakeholders differs whether you're part of a Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agency, a component or subcomponent of a CFO Act agency, or a small independent agency. These differences may show up in the amount of staffing resources or funding available that can be applied to the implementation of Section 508 policy.

Whether you're working as a solo Section 508 PM, additional duties as assigned, or as part of a Section 508 Program team, the Section 508 program should serve as a resource, offering advisory support and oversight to cross-functional stakeholders with respect to digital accessibility considerations. The Section 508 PM coordinates with domain experts across the agency to promote information and communication technology (ICT) compliance and conformance. Whether you are a Section 508 PM or part-time Section 508 PM, this document can:

## Section 508 Team Functions, Roles and Responsibilities
The table below outlines the essential functions for implementing Section 508 accessibility program goals, including the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders with whom Section 508 PMs collaborate, as per OMB guidance ([M-24-08](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/)). Section 508 PMs should focus on promoting a sense of ownership and independence amongst the functional experts throughout their agency. By having experts serve as advisors or on an advisory group, the Section 508 program enables them to develop and refine their Section 508 skills and competencies within their domain.

Some of these stakeholder may not exist in smaller agencies or subcomponents. In such cases, if a Section 508 PM is preparing a budget justification for additional staff, they can use the functional responsibilities listed below as a guide for drafting future position descriptions or identifying staffing needs and skill requirements for their Section 508 program.

## Building a Well-Coordinated Section 508 Program Team
Section 508 PMs should be targeted in their efforts to socialize the importance of all domain experts involved in Section 508 compliance and conformance. There are a variety of benefits to establishing a cadence of continual collaboration, connection, communication, and interdependence amongst Section 508 stakeholders and experts across acquisition, human capital, IT, CX, and contracting.
