  * **Identify content creators.** Identify who is responsible for generating high priority electronic content. Ensure content creators understand how to create WCAG conforming websites, web applications, software, multimedia, and eLearning content.

  * **Engage your Communications Office.** Solicit their help to identify major components and processes within your organization that support electronic content development and publication. Some of these groups may not be aware of Section 508 requirements.

  * **Communicate to internal stakeholders.** Explain the legal mandate and requirements.  [Read more about why accessibility is good for business][3], and share the benefits with employees. Finally, provide content authors with resources and training.
