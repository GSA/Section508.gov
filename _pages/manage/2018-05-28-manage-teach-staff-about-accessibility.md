Accessibility is not just a legal mandate, it is also good for business. Use these quick tips to help content creators, developers and other stakeholders adhere to the  [Revised 508 Standards][1], while delivering better content, products and systems to your customers.

  * **Review the scope.** Refer to the scoping provision in [Section E205][2] to see how it applies to electronic content that is created and updated by web content managers, developers, authors of electronic (e.g., Microsoft Office or Adobe PDF) documents, and other content authors. Generally, content authors should be responsible for ensuring their content is accessible.

  * **Identify content creators.** Identify who is responsible for generating high priority electronic content. Ensure content creators understand how to create WCAG conforming websites, web applications, software, multimedia, and eLearning content.

  * **Engage your Communications Office.** Solicit their help to identify major components and processes within your organization that support electronic content development and publication. Some of these groups may not be aware of Section 508 requirements.

  * **Communicate to internal stakeholders.** Explain the legal mandate and requirements.  [Read more about why accessibility is good for business][3], and share the benefits with employees. Finally, provide content authors with resources and training.

  * **Encourage authors to**  [take IT accessibility training][4]. Training is available in a variety of formats, including online.

  * **Establish accessibility review guidelines.** Determine a review process for each department responsible for publishing covered electronic content. Insert accessibility reviews into existing development and publication lifecycles.
