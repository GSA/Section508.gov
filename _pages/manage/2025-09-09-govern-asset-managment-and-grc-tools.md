Integrating Section 508 conformance data, such as test reports or Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACR) into IT product portfolios—like asset and application inventories or [Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/glossary/#g) tools—is crucial for ensuring Section 508 conformance across an agency’s digital ecosystem. Effective execution of these practices supports informed procurement decisions, facilitates audits, strengthens governance, and enhances risk management, all while optimizing documentation storage.

## Asset Inventory Tools

Federal agencies track their information and communication technology (ICT) in an inventory of information systems and each agency may have a different name for their asset management system or model. Regardless of the specific system, Section 508 conformance should be integrated. This integration enables users to easily determine if a product is conformant and identify any existing barriers to accessibility.

<div class="border-base radius-lg border-1px padding-1 bg-primary-lighter" style="margin-top: 1.0em;"><strong>Tip</strong>: Require each Section 508-related field to be filled out when a new product is listed. This may involve integrating Section 508 conformance questions during intake and as part of IT governance.</div>

Consider updating the TRM or equivalent to include the following fields:

<ul class="usa-icon-list">
  <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
    <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-green">
      <svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img">

      </svg>
    </div>
    <div class="usa-icon-list__content"> 
    Section 508 conformance status such as Fully Conformant, Partially Conformant, Not Conformant, or Not Tested. This helps users easily identify products with ICT accessibility defects.

    <div class="usa-icon-list__content">
    Section 508 exception identification number, if applicable.
    </div>
    </li> 
    </ul>

A new test report, demonstrating Section 508 conformance of the version currently in use, should be acquired and linked within the tracking tool whenever a product is updated to a new version.

<div class="border-base radius-lg border-1px padding-1 bg-primary-lighter" style="margin-top: 1.0em;"><p><strong>Tip</strong>: All Section 508-related data fields should be reviewed by a designated accessibility compliance officer such as the agency's Section 508 Program Manager, member of the Section 508 Program or other designee, or control owner before entry is finalized. Agencies should establish periodic data quality checks to ensure records reflect an accurate and current conformance status of each ICT product.</p></div>

<h2>GRC Tools</h2>

Federal agencies utilize Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tools to centralize, standardize, and automate the management of policies, risks, audits, and compliance activities.

While the exact GRC tool or platform may vary, most allow:

By aligning Section 508 controls with existing digital policy mandates such as <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_Memo.pdf" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Modernizing the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) (M-24-15)</a>, agencies can unify information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility with IT governance. Where possible, agencies should align Section 508 controls with related compliance domains, such as information security, privacy, and records management, to enable unified workflows and reduce duplication of compliance activities. Integrating Section 508 into the agency's GRC tools ensures ICT accessibility is not treated as an afterthought, but rather as a managed and measurable part of the agency’s overall risk and compliance posture. Per M-24-15 agencies should “\[e\]nsure that agency governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) tools and system inventory tools can produce, transmit, and ingest machine readable authorization artifacts using OSCAL or any succeeding formats as identified by FedRAMP”.

Agencies must ensure GRC and inventory tools themselves meet Section 508 requirements. This includes conducting accessibility testing of the platforms, reviewing vendor ACRs, and documenting alternate access methods if full conformance is not possible.

The following table outlines the integration of Section 508 considerations into GRC tools, detailing the actions, steps, and expected outcomes.

<h2>Procurement Integration</h2>

Procurement teams should verify Section 508 conformance status and review test reports before awarding new contracts or renewing existing ICT procurements. The agency’s TRM or GRC system should serve as a source of record for this review, and solicitations should require vendors to provide updated accessibility conformance documentation.

<h2>Monitoring and Maintenance</h2>

Agencies should regularly monitor their IT portfolio and tracking systems to ensure governance policies and procedures are followed. It is recommended that IT is assessed every 12-36 months or on a frequency based on risk assessment of non-conformant IT, to determine if conformance status has changed. If retesting after a product update identifies significant new accessibility barriers, the agency should log the defect in the GRC system, initiate remediation workflows, and, where feasible, revert to a prior accessible version until the issue is resolved.
