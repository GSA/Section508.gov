---
## Am I required to fill out this assessment?
All Federal departments or agencies covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are required to fill out the Annual Section 508 Assessment.

## Are all questions required?
The majority of the questions are required but there are several optional questions. Some questions are dependent on previous answers and will not be provided if they do not apply to your agency. For example, if you select that your agency does not use automated testing tools, you will not be presented  additional questions about automated testing tools in your agency.

## What do I input and/or select if I don't know an answer?
If an agency is unable to provide the requested information because it is currently unavailable, the agency should select “Unknown” or “N/A”. In rare instances, you may need to input "0" into a text field. Agencies will have opportunities to collect any unavailable information during future reporting periods of the annual assessment.

## What if I don't have 10 web pages, 10 documents and/or 5 videos to test? 
If your agency does not have 10 web pages (intranet/internet), 10 electronic documents, or 5 videos, please test the number of web pages, documents, and/or videos you do have and report on those. Please select N/A when additional web pages, electronic documents, or videos do not exist.

## What if I don't have resources to complete the requested testing? 
If you do not have resources available to complete the requested testing of ICT products prior to the submission deadline, please test what you can. If you cannot test anything, please select "Unavailable- agency does not have resources to test". For Question 40 regarding ICT solicitations, if you are unable to review any of the previous 10 solicitations, please select "Unknown".

## I do not have a link to submit my agency assessment. What do I need to do to get one?
Please reach out to the GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility team at <Section.508@gsa.gov> in order to verify point of contact for your agency and resolve access issues.

## What is the final date for submitting my agency's answers?
The reporting tool will close on August 11, 2023 at 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time. No responses can be submitted or altered after that date.

## Can my agency rely solely on a vendor's ACR to inform whether or not our product is fully accessible for this year's assessment? This applies to Conformance questions 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 88, and 90. 
Yes, you may use a vendor's ACR to report whether or not the ICT product(s) referenced in Conformance questions 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 88, and 90 are fully conformant to all applicable Section 508 standards.

## Will there be a working session or sessions to review the questions and receive any clarifications needed?
Yes. The GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility team will host office hours starting April 11th. Please check the [Support page]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/section-508-assessment/support/) and [Events page]({{site.baseurl}}/events/) for all sessions and how to register. The GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility team will also use the May and July Section 508 Program Manager huddles will dedicate time to answering questions on the report.

## As a department/agency with components, what information should I report on?
Agency components (e.g., bureaus, sub-agencies, or major organizational divisions as determined by the agency) must be reported independently of their “parent” agency. “Parent” agencies must limit reporting to that of the parent agency and not include reporting from component agencies.

## As a parent agency, will I have visibility into component level data that is submitted?
Yes, component level data will be shared with the parent agency upon submittal.

## How will reported data be used?
GSA, in consultation with OMB, will prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive assessment that includes information identifying the metrics and data collected, compliance by each agency, and by the federal government generally, a detailed description of the actions, activities, and other efforts made by GSA over the year preceding to support compliance at agencies and any planned efforts in the coming year to improve compliance at agencies, and a list of recommendations that agencies or Congress may take to help support that compliance.

The goals of GSA's analysis are to:
<ol type="a">
    <li>Gain a deeper understanding of the state of ICT accessibility across the federal Government</li>
    <li>Identify opportunities to educate the workforce, and reduce redundancies, remediation, and waste</li>
    <li>Improve collaboration across agencies, develop common solutions, and enable future shared services; and</li>
    <li>Inform recommendations that improve the implementation and management of Section 508 across the federal government to ensure that people with disabilities have equitable access to information and data.</li>
</ol>

GSA and OMB will evaluate and approximate agency maturity across the following core dimensions:
<ol type="a">
    <li>IT Accessibility Program Office - Measuring how well program governance, risk management, and compliance is managed</li>
    <li>Policies, Procedures, and Standards - Measuring the extent to which agencies establish, integrate, and comply with policies, procedures, and standards that support ICT accessibility</li>
    <li>Acquisition and Procurement - Measuring the extent to which agencies include, review, and validate contracts for ICT accessibility compliance requirements</li>
    <li>Technology Lifecycle Activities - Measuring the extent to which agencies incorporate ICT accessibility requirements into enterprise architecture, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance</li>
    <li>Testing and Validation - Measuring the extent to which agencies conduct testing and validation of ICT accessibility and Section 508 conformance claims</li>
    <li>Communications - Measuring how well agencies communicate and monitor all ICT accessibility program activities, including tracking and resolving non-compliance issues</li>
    <li> Content Creation - Measuring the extent to which agencies make their digital content (e.g., websites, documents, video and other media, social media, electronic forms, and digital signatures) accessible</li>
    <li>Training - Measuring the extent to which agencies train stakeholders on roles and responsibilities related to compliance with Section 508 practices and requirements</li>
    <li>Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership - Measuring your agency's leadership and professional development and how ICT accessibility is integrated into mission-related strategic planning</li>
</ol>

The report will be submitted to Congress no later than December 29. The report will also be made available on a public website.

Submitted agency data will be maintained in a publicly available, machine readable format (i.e. as a 44 U.S.C 3502 (20) open Government data asset). Other organizations may choose to use this data for their own purposes.

## How do I estimate Full Time Equivalents (FTEs)?
When reporting the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) your agency has in its Section 508 Program office or equivalent, this number should reflect the FTEs of individuals who directly support the activities of the Section 508 Program office or equivalent, and not individuals responsible for accessibility as a matter of practice within their regular duties in other organizational business units. 

When it is not possible to ascertain the number of employee or contractor hours being spent on the agency Section 508 Program office or equivalent, please estimate. Determine the percentage of 508 work being performed on the contract, then apply this percentage to the total cost of the contract, and divide that dollar value by the average cost of each FTE.

## How is the assessment laid out?
This is a self-report assessment with 11 dimensions which are categorized as:
<ol type="a">
    <li>General questions ask about information and metrics related to the activities of your agency's Section 508 Program’s (or equivalent) activities.</li>
    <li>Conformance Metrics that measure how well your agency’s ICT meets technical standards for accessibility, including websites, electronic documents, and multimedia</li>
    <li>IT Accessibility Program Office - Measuring how well program governance, risk management, and compliance is managed.</li>
    <li>Policies, Procedures, and Standards - Measuring the extent to which agencies establish, integrate, and comply with policies, procedures, and standards that support ICT accessibility.</li>
    <li>Acquisition and Procurement - Measuring the extent to which agencies include, review, and validate contracts for ICT accessibility compliance requirements.</li>
    <li>Technology Lifecycle Activities - Measuring the extent to which agencies incorporate ICT accessibility requirements into enterprise architecture, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance.</li>
    <li>Testing and Validation - Measuring the extent to which agencies conduct testing and validation of ICT accessibility and Section 508 conformance claims.</li>
    <li>Communications - Measuring how well agencies communicate and monitor all ICT accessibility program activities, including tracking and resolving non-compliance issues.</li>
    <li>Content Creation - Measuring the extent to which agencies make their digital content (e.g., websites, documents, video and other media, social media, electronic forms, and digital signatures) accessible.</li>
    <li>Training - Measuring the extent to which agencies train stakeholders on roles and responsibilities related to compliance with Section 508 practices and requirements.</li>
    <li>Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership - Measuring your agency's leadership and professional development and how ICT accessibility is integrated into mission-related strategic planning.</li>
</ol>

## How do I determine frequency of activities?
<ol type="a">
    <li>Never: 0%</li>
    <li>Sometimes/Some: Activities that are performed approximately 1%-24% of the time.</li>
    <li>Regularly: Activities that are performed approximately 25%-59% of the time.</li>
    <li>Frequently: Activities that are performed approximately 60%-89% of the time.</li>
    <li>Almost always: Activities that are performed approximately 90% or more of the time.</li>
</ol>

## Will I be able to write open-ended explanations to answer selections?
Yes. At the end of the assessment tool, there will be an open-ended question (see Question 105 General Information) where you may write any additional details about your program, answer selections, etc. Please use this form field to provide any additional narrative you would like. When referencing a specific question, please put the Dimension (e.g., Conformance Metrics) and the question number (e.g., Question 76).

## Who will send the assessment link to the reporting tool?	
Registered POCs will recieve, on or about June 1st, an email from "Section.508@gsa.gov" with instructions to access to tool. If you do not receive this email, check your email's junk folder. Note: Since the email is sent from a collection tool, the email sender may appear as "ogpsurveysupport@research.gsa.gov".
