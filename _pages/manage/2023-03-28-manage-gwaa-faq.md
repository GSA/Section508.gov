---
## Am I required to fill out this assessment?
Agencies/organizations who must submit the report will be notified by OMB in coordination with the General Services Administration and the US Access Board.

## Are all questions required?
The majority of the questions are required but there are several optional questions. Some questions are dependent on previous answers and will not be provided if they do not apply to you. For example, if you select that your agency does not use automated testing tools, you will not be presented  additional questions about automated testing tools in your agency.

## What do I input and/or select if I don't know an answer?
If an agency is unable to provide the requested information because it is currently unavailable, the agency should select “Unknown” or “N/A”. In rare instances, you may need to input "0" into a text field. gencies will have opportunities to collect any unavailable information during future reporting periods of the annual assessment.

## What do I input and/or select if I don't know an answer?
If you are presented a question and do not know how to respond and cannot find that data before the submission deadline, please select Unknown (where applicable) or input 0 (if a text field).

## What if I don't have 10 web pages, documents and/or 5 videos to test? 
If your agency does not have 10 web pages (intranet/internet), 10 electronic documents, or 5 videos, please test the number of web pages, documents, and/or videos you do have and report on those.

## What if I don't have resources to complete the requested testing? 
If you do not have resources available to complete the requested testing of ICT products and solicitations prior to the submission deadline, please test what you can. If you cannot test anything, please put 0 (if a text field is offered) or unknown (if shown as an response).

## I do not have a link to submit my agency assessment. What do I need to do to get one?
Please reach out to the Government-wide IT Accessibility Team at <Section.508@gsa.gov> in order to verify point of contract for your agency and resolve access issues.	

## What is the final date for submitting my agency's answers?
The reporting tool will close on August 11, 2023 at 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time. No responses can be submitted or altered after that date.

## Can my agency rely solely on an ACR to inform whether or not our product is fully accessible for this year's assessment? This applies to questions [insert questions that this is applicable to once we have the tool built]
TBD

## Will there be a working session or sessions to review the questions and receive any clarifications needed?
Yes, the May and July Section 508 Program Manager huddles will dedicate time to answering questions on the report. Additionally, the Government-wide Section 508 team will be conducting regular office hours after the questions are released to answer questions and assist agencies with submitting their data. Please check the events page at [insert link] to see upcoming sessions.

## As an department/agency with component agencies, what information should I report on?
Headquarters at agencies with components should only report headquarters data; components will be required to submit their own data separately.

## As a parent agency, will I have visibility into component level data that is submitted?
Yes, component level data will be shared with the parent agency upon submittal.

## Will this assessment data be used for the DOJ biennial report on the accessibility of the federal government’s websites and digital technologies?
We do not anticipate that the DOJ will release any additional assessment criteria for their biennial report and will use the information in this annual data collection to inform their biennial report.

## Will I be able to edit my agency's data up until the deadline of August 11, 2023, even if I have submitted the data before the deadline?

## How will reported data be used?
GSA, in coordination with OMB, will prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive assessment that includes information identifying the metrics and data collected, compliance by each agency, and by the Federal Government generally, a detailed description of the actions, activities, and other efforts made by GSA over the year preceding [report] submission to support compliance at agencies and any planned efforts in the coming year to improve compliance at agencies, and a list of recommendations that agencies or Congress may take to help support that compliance.

The goals of GSA's analysis are to:
<ol type="a">
<li>Gain a deeper understanding of the state of ICT accessibility across the federal Government</li>
<li>Identify opportunities to educate the workforce, and reduce redundancies, remediation, and waste</li>
<li>Improve collaboration across agencies, develop common solutions, and enable future shared services; and</li>
<li>Inform recommendations that improve the implementation and management of Section 508 across the federal government to ensure that people with disabilities have equitable access to information and data.</li>
</ol>

The report will be submitted to Congress no later than December 29. The report will also be made available on a public website.

Submitted agency data will be maintained in a publicly available, machine readable format (i.e. as a 44 U.S.C 3502 (20) open Government data asset). Other organizations may choose to use this data for their own purposes.

## How do I estimate Full Time Equivalents (FTEs)?
When reporting the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) your agency has in its Section 508 Program office or equivalent, this number should reflect the FTEs of individuals who directly support the activities of the Section 508 Program office or equivalent, and not individuals responsible for accessibility as a matter of practice within their regular duties role in other organizational business units. 

When it is not possible to ascertain the number of employee or contractor hours being spent on the agency Section 508 Program office or equivalent, please estimate. Determine the percentage of 508 work being performed on the contract, then apply this percentage to the total cost of the contract, and divide that dollar value by the average cost of each FTE.

## How is the assessment laid out?
This is a self-report assessment which are categorized as:
- General questions that are informational and provide context to the overall agency maturity and implementation of Section 508 requirements.
- Conformance Metrics that measure how well your agency’s ICT meets technical standards for accessibility, including websites, electronic documents, and multimedia.
- Maturity questions – which will be used to evaluate and approximate that maturity of your agency’s approach to implementing Section 508 requirements – are grouped into dimensions, and provide you an opportunity to evaluate your agency’s accessibility practices, policies, and procedures.

GSA and OMB will evaluate and approximate agency maturity across the following core dimensions:
- IT Accessibility Program Office - Measuring how well program governance, risk management, and compliance is managed,
- Policies, Procedures, and Standards - Measuring the extent to which agencies establish, integrate, and comply with policies, procedures, and standards that support ICT accessibility,
- Acquisition and Procurement - Measuring the extent to which agencies include, review, and validate contracts for ICT accessibility compliance requirements.
- Technology Lifecycle Activities - Measuring the extent to which agencies incorporate ICT accessibility requirements into enterprise architecture, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance.
- Testing and Validation - Measuring the extent to which agencies conduct testing and validation of ICT accessibility and Section 508 conformance claims.
- Communications - Measuring how well agencies communicate and monitor all ICT accessibility program activities, including tracking and resolving non-compliance issues.
- Content Creation - Measuring the extent to which agencies make their digital content (e.g., websites, documents, video and other media, social media, electronic forms, and digital signatures) accessible.
- Training - Measuring the extent to which agencies train stakeholders on roles and responsibilities related to compliance with Section 508 practices and requirements.
- Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership - Measuring your agency's leadership and professional development and how ICT accessibility is integrated into mission-related strategic planning.

## How do I determine frequency of activities?
Never: 0%
- Sometimes/Some: Activities that are performed 1%-24% of the time.
- Regularly: Activities that are performed 25%-59% of the time.
- Frequently: Activities that are performed 60%-89% of the time.
- Almost always: Activities that are performed 90% or more of the time.

## Will I be able to write open-ended explanations to answer selections?
Yes. At the end of the assessment tool, there will be an open-ended question (see Question 10 General Information) where you may write any additional details about your program, answer selections,etc. Please use this form field to provide any additional narrative you would like. When referencing a specific question, please put the Dimension (e.g., Conformance Metrics) and the question number (Question 4).

## What could be included in assessment criteria in future years?
Future assessments could include additional inquiries about the agency’s testing methodologies and practices to ensure the accuracy of test results and conformance claims and to build on our shared understanding of testing across government. For example, a future iteration of this Section 508 Accessibility Assessment may ask whether the agency’s test methodology aligns to the appropriate ICT Testing Baseline. The ICT Testing Baseline(s) identify the minimum requirements of Section 508 testing methodologies. Agencies are strongly encouraged to become familiar with and plan to align their testing methodologies to the ICT Testing Baseline. For more information please visit the Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline website or email ictbaseline@gsa.gov.

With improved test methodologies come more accurate test results, which may raise or lower your agency’s conformance levels. Any change in testing methodology (more content is tested, automated tools are configured differently, manual testing is performed, etc.) will impact test results. This adjustment in conformance level is expected. Lower conformance levels due to more accurate testing should not be viewed as negative. The goals for testing are to accurately assess ICT conformance, identify Section 508 issues, and enable an agency to have confidence in their 508 conformance claims.

## What does the Conformance reporting page look like to report defects by Section 508 Standard/WCAG Success Criteria?
TBD - [placeholder, we need to include this when we have the layout].

## Will I be able to edit my agency's data up until the deadline of August 11, 2023, even if I have submitted the data before the deadline?
TBD
