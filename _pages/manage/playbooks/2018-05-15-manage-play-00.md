## Intended Audience
Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) offices, Agency Section 508 Program Managers, and those assisting with the execution of tasks within agency Section 508 Program Offices, or equivalents. 

## Our Challenge
The American people expect to interact with the government through information and communication technology (ICT) such as websites, mobile applications, kiosks and other electronic channels. With over <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0716-Adult-disability.html" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">70 Million U.S. adults reported having a disability</a>, it is imperative that today our digital products and services are usable by everyone. Too many of our digital services and technology solutions are not accessible to members of the public or federal employees who have disabilities. As more government services have moved online, federal agencies have a continuing responsibility to ensure government technology is accessible to people with disabilities. <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/about/law/ra.html#section-508-federal-electronic-and-information-technology" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d)</a> is a federal law that mandates federal agencies "develop, procure, maintain, or use" ICT that meets the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">ICT Accessibility Standards and Guidelines</a>.

Better accessibility supports many areas of information assurance, including security and privacy. Accessible websites are easier to maintain, more mobile-friendly, and deliver a better user experience. When we design IT systems to be accessible from the outset, we avoid having to make expensive retrofits to comply with policy and reduce the risk of user complaints and costly lawsuits. Accessible and easy-to-use technology solutions can improve public perception of the government.

## Purpose 
Executive support for accessible IT is essential to increase compliance with federal policy and help agencies deliver a digital user experience that is accessible to all. The Technology Accessibility Playbook provides a framework for the integration of strategic, business, and technology management to ensure that US Federal Government ICT is accessible to people with disabilities. Drawn from successful practices in both government and the private sector, this guide aims to help Federal CIOs and senior executives improve the accessibility of Federal ICT through advocacy, strong governance, and appropriate resourcing of accessibility business functions.

Federal agencies can meet Section 508 requirements by implementing the plays from this Technology Accessibility Playbook, which help agencies address key imperatives, including:
* Education and awareness of what is needed to build and manage effective agency Section 508 Programs.
* Strategic planning for increased agency Section 508 compliance and effective management of information technology.
* Expanded access to federal government digital services by people with disabilities.

This Playbook includes guidance to help agencies take the necessary steps to comply with related requirements, including:
* Established federal guidelines for technology accessibility and digital services.
* Current federal guidance and standards for digital design and user experience.
* Technology acquisitions informed by federal accessibility and procurement guidelines.

## Introduction and Key Elements of a Section 508 Program
The Playbook contains this introduction, called Play Zero, plus twelve key "plays" drawn from successful practices in the government and private sector for creating, implementing, managing and executing the operations of a Section 508 Program. The plays are listed in the general order they should be considered; however all of the plays are interdependent. Maturing a Section 508 Program requires an iterative approach to implementing the plays across an agency.

This introduction describes the following foundational elements that support the other plays in the Playbook:
* Program Foundations, Leadership, and Governance (Plays 1-4)
* Integration into Agency Operations (Plays 5-8)
* Continuous Improvement, Compliance, and Workforce Development (Plays 9-12)

### Establishing Program Foundations
#### Leadership Commitment to Accessibility

Agency leadership plays a critical role in ensuring Section 508 compliance. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) (or equivalents) should actively support accessibility initiatives and provide the necessary authority and resources for compliance efforts.

Actions for leadership:

* Publicly affirm accessibility as an agency priority.
* Ensure accessibility is integrated into IT governance structures.
* Allocate resources for program staffing, training, and compliance monitoring.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">

        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>
        <div class="usa-icon-list__content">See <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook/1/">Play 1: Establish a Section 508 Program Manager to Lead Compliance Efforts</a> for additional details on leadership roles.</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Document Current Program Maturity

A successful Section 508 Program begins with an assessment of its current state. Agencies should leverage existing data sources, including the[  Governmentwide Section 508 Assessment]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/section-508-assessment/) to evaluate program maturity. The assessment should cover:

* Governance and leadership engagement
* Policy and compliance integration
* Testing and validation processes
* Workforce training and technical assistance
* Acquisition and procurement conformance tracking

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>
        <div class="usa-icon-list__content">(See <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook/2/">Play 2: Assess Your Section 508 Program Maturity</a> for detailed guidance on program assessment.)</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Define Program Goals and Performance Metrics
Agencies should establish clear objectives for improving Section 508 compliance, aligned with federal accessibility directives and agency-specific priorities. Goals should be measurable and tied to existing reporting mechanisms.

Key considerations:
* Define short-term and long-term accessibility objectives
* Establish benchmarks using agency self-assessment results
* Align[  performance metrics]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/accessibility-kpi/) with agency-wide IT and procurement processes

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Performance Accountability for Leadership
Ensuring Section 508 compliance requires leadership accountability at all levels. Agencies should incorporate accessibility objectives into performance plans for senior executives and IT managers to drive program success.

Recommended actions:
* Institute a clear Section 508 Policy that states the purpose, agency's commitments, establishes authorities, and defines expectations for how Section 508 compliance will be addressed across acquisition, development, authoring, configuration, deployment, and maintenance activities.
* Include Section 508 compliance in executive-level and IT leadership performance plans.
* Require periodic reporting on accessibility progress and challenges.
* Conduct executive briefings to maintain leadership engagement.

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Policy Integration Across the Agency
Each agency should adopt and enforce Section 508 policies at the department, component, and division levels. Policies should specify:
* Responsibilities for ensuring accessibility in acquisitions and IT development
* Integration of accessibility reviews in governance and approval processes
* Agency mechanisms for tracking and resolving non-compliance issues

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Integration into Agency Operations
#### Governance and Coordination
Section 508 compliance requires coordination across multiple agency functions. The Section 508 Program Office should operate as a strategic advisory body, supporting program implementation across acquisition, IT, and human resources.

Key elements:
* Establish a cross-functional accessibility governance team
* Integrate Section 508 compliance into agency performance reviews
* Ensure accessibility requirements are incorporated into IT lifecycle management

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Budget Considerations for Accessibility
Agencies should allocate sufficient resources to support accessibility initiatives. This includes budgeting for:
* Compliance testing and validation tools
* Training and professional development for staff
* Technical assistance and remediation efforts

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>
        <div class="usa-icon-list__content"><p>See <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook/5/">Play 5: Develop a Section 508 Program Team</a> for best practices on resource allocation.</p></div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Section 508 as an Enterprise Function
To ensure compliance at scale, accessibility responsibilities should be distributed across agency divisions rather than centralized in a single office. The Section 508 Program Office should provide guidance, tools, and expertise but should not serve as the sole entity responsible for implementation.

Best practices:
* Define clear [roles and responsibilities]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/roles/) for accessibility within each division.
* Establish agency-wide policies integrating accessibility into IT and procurement processes.
* Provide technical assistance and training to distributed teams.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Leadership Oversight and Program Sustainability
To ensure long-term sustainability, accessibility initiatives should be embedded within agency governance structures.

Best practices:
* Conduct annual reviews of your agency's Section 508 compliance outcomes
* Integrate accessibility into digital modernization initiatives
* Maintain ongoing collaboration with interagency accessibility groups

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
    <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
        <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#push_pin"></use></svg></div>

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Align Accessibility Needs into Design Processes
A best practice is to work with usability professionals, requirements analysts, developers, and designers to incorporate accessibility as a core requirement.

Best Practices:
* Use a range of research methods to determine the goals, needs, preferences, and expectations of potential users with disabilities 
* When possible, create a proof-of-concept or prototype to validate potential technological approaches with representative users with disabilities
* Identify approaches that could lower or remove user interaction barriers

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

#### Embedding Accessibility into Acquisition Processes
* Ensure Section 508 compliance requirements are properly included in solicitation language
* Validate Section 508 conformance claims and mitigate compliance risks
* Ensure digital services and technology solutions meet Section 508 requirements

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">

    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

### Continuous Improvement, Compliance, and Workforce Development
#### Align Accessibility with Development Processes
In order to avoid the risks and costs associated with fixing accessibility at the end of development processes, it's critical that accessibility needs are incorporated early in development.

Best practices:

* Ensure developers and designers understand their responsibilities under Section 508, and know how to incorporate accessibility as a core requirement for all IT projects
* Encourage collaboration between developers, usability professionals, and requirements analysts
* Include IT accessibility subject matter experts as authoritative decision makers at critical development checkpoints

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <ul class="usa-icon-list tablet:grid-col">
