## Chatbot Accessibility Playbook
As governments increase their use of automation, users increasingly encounter “chatbots” while seeking information or services. Chatbots allow organizations to provide that information or that service without the assistance of a real person. 

A chatbot is a computer program or software solution that automates conversation with a user. They can be programmed with different responses based on what a user chooses or requests. Most chatbots are programmed to provide specific responses utilizing planned conversation trees. However, advanced bots are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing and can dynamically respond to a user's requests.

In addition to evidence-based resources and recommendations, the Chatbot Accessibility Playbook provides checklists to address accessibility during the design and development process.
