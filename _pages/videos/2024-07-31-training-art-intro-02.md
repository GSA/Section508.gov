    <p>Voice Over (VO): Where is ART and how do I use it?</p>
    <p>(VO): To get started with ART, open your browser and go to Section508.gov/art.</p>
    <p>(VO): Then, select the button that says, “Select to get started.”</p>
    <p>(VO): Next, enter your name, and the name of the type of ICT product or service that you are procuring.</p>
    <p>(VO): For this example, we will enter “security equipment,” though your product may have a different description, like “video editing software,” or “public visitor website.”</p>
    <p>(VO): Type in the item you need, then select the “Add” button.</p>
    <p>(VO): Select “Continue” to move to the next step.</p>
    <p>(VO): Now, you can start filling out some information about the ICT you need, which will help ART generate your report.</p>
    <p>(VO): Do you need a report to put together solicitation documents, or are you doing market research?</p>
    <p>(VO): What exceptions apply to your situation?</p>
    <p>(VO): What types of hardware and software will be involved in your ICT?</p>
    <p>(VO): For each question, select the answer (or answers) that best apply to your ICT product.</p>
    <p>(VO): As you answer each question, more questions will appear for you to go into more detail.</p>
    <p>(VO): Keep answering questions until you reach the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p>(VO): Once you have answered all of the questions, you will have two options.</p>
    <p>(VO): If you select “Save (.json), you will download a JSON file, which you can use if you want to make edits or continue working on your list at a later time.</p>
    <p>(VO): If you select “Get 508 Results,” you will see a page that lists all of the Section 508 standards that apply to the situation you described with your responses.</p>
    <p>(VO): This page also includes some helpful instructions about how this list will help you as you continue the procurement process, so be sure to review these instructions carefully.</p>
    <p>(VO): This video is a product of the General Services Administration.</p>
