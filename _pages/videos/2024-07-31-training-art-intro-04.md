    <p>Voice Over (VO): How do I generate lists for multiple procurements?</p>
    <p>(VO): Many times, when you are procuring ICT, you are procuring multiple products.</p>
    <p>(VO): For example, you may need new phones and some new phone answering software.</p>
    <p>(VO): In these cases, it is helpful to have a report for each ICT you procure.</p>
    <p>(VO): To generate multiple reports using ART, go to Section 508 dot gov, select the “Select to get started” button, and fill out your name like before.</p>
    <p>(VO): Then, enter each product that you need, and ART will help you generate a separate list of standards for each product.</p>
    <p>(VO): For this example, let’s say that, in addition to security equipment, we also need a solution for data storage.</p>
    <p>(VO): So, I would enter “security equipment” then select the “Add” button, and then go back to the same field as before, enter “data storage,” select “Add,” and then select “Continue” to move to the next step.</p>
    <p>(VO): This takes me to the form page for my first ICT, which is the security equipment.</p>
    <p>(VO): So first, I fill out the form answering all questions as they apply to the security equipment.</p>
    <p>(VO): After answering all of the questions, I select the “Next ICT” button at the end of the form.</p>
    <p>(VO): This takes me to the form page for my next ICT, which is data storage, so I answer the same set of questions as they apply to that ICT.</p>
    <p>(VO): Throughout this process, I can add additional ICT items by going to the top of the form, entering the additional item (like “security software,” for example), and then selecting the “Add” button.</p>
    <p>(VO): I can also delete an ICT item from my list of procurements by going to the bottom of the form page and selecting the “Delete Current ICT” button.</p>
    <p>(VO): Once you have answered all of the questions for all of your ICT products, you can either select “Save dot JSON” to download a JSON file and continue working on your list at a later time, or you can select “Get 508 Results” to continue to the report page.</p>
    <p>(VO): On the report page, you can navigate between the reports generated for each ICT on your list, using the buttons labeled “Next ICT” and “Previous ICT.”</p>
    <p>(VO): You have all the same options as before to copy or download the report you are currently viewing.</p>
    <p>(VO): Use the “Download all ICTs” button to download a zip file to download all of your reports in JSON format.</p>
    <p>(VO): This video is a product of the General Services Administration.</p>
