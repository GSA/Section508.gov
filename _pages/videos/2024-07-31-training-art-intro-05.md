    <p>Voice Over (VO): How do I use JSON to modify my report?</p>
    <p>(VO): If you leave the Section 508 website and then revisit it at another time, your progress and responses on ART are not saved.</p>
    <p>(VO): However, if you can’t finish filling out the questions in one sitting, or if you want to go back and edit how you responded to the questions, you can use JSON to save your progress.</p>
    <p>(VO): JSON is a file format designed to save lists of data.</p>
    <p>(VO): In this case, ART allows you to save how you responded to each question.</p>
    <p>(VO): When you re-upload this JSON file, it will update ART with the exact responses and information you had originally filled out.</p>
    <p>(VO): To save your JSON file, you can select the “Save (.json)” button at the bottom of the form page.</p>
    <p>(VO): The JSON file will immediately start downloading.</p>
    <p>(VO): The same “Save” button is also on the summary page, in case you are finished with filling out the form, but you want to be able to change your responses later.</p>
    <p>(VO): Once you have downloaded the JSON file, give it a memorable file name so you can easily find it later.</p>
    <p>(VO): When you are ready to continue using ART, go to Section508.gov/art.</p>
    Then, select the button that says, “Continue where you left off.”</p>
    <p>(VO): On this page, enter your name, and then upload the JSON file that you saved earlier, either by dragging the file into the space, or by selecting “choose from folder” and selecting the JSON file from there.</p>
    <p>(VO): After that, select the “Upload” button, and then select the “Continue” button.</p>
    <p>(VO): This will take you back to the form page, with all of your responses already filled in.</p>
    <p>(VO): From here, you can make whatever changes you want to make to your responses, and finish the form normally.</p>
    <p>(VO): Remember that if you make changes and want to save your progress again, you will need to save the JSON file again so that it includes the changes and updates that you made.</p>
    <p>(VO): This video is a product of the General Services Administration.</p>
