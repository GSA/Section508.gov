This page is intended to instruct users on how to develop an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) using a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT<sup>&trade;</sup>). For more information on ACRs and VPATs<sup>&trade;</sup> visit the Acquisition section of Section508.gov.

The ACR is a representation of how the product meets the applicable Section 508 Technical Standards. The product owner/developer must first test the product against those standards in order to complete an ACR. Currently, the most common way an ACR is completed is by using the (VPAT<sup>&trade;</sup> template created by the IT Industry Council (ITI).

Although there are other possible methods to complete an ACR, this part of the guide will walk you through how to complete an ACR using the VPAT<sup>&trade;</sup>.

## Step 1: Download the VPAT<sup>&trade;</sup> ##
The VPATTM is a free template that may be downloaded by going to the [ITI website][2].
If you are selling to the U.S. federal government, then you must use the Revised Section 508 or the INT International Editions of the template  (which include all Revised Section 508 requirements).
