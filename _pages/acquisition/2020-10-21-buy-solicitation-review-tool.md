The <a href="https://srt.app.cloud.gov/" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Solicitation Review Tool (SRT)</a> was developed to help agencies assess and improve the accessibility compliance of solicitations—and in the future, it will also support reviews for cybersecurity and other regulatory requirements.

The SRT is built with open-source technology and uses artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, text mining, and machine learning to automatically detect whether new solicitations posted on federal acquisition platforms are for Information and Communication Technology (ICT). If a solicitation is identified as ICT-related, the SRT then checks whether it includes adequate Section 508 compliance requirements to support accessibility in federal IT.

The SRT scans the <a href="https://www.sam.gov" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external"><strong>SAM.gov</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.ebuy.gov" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external"><strong>eBuy.gov</strong></a> every 24 hours, across all solicitations and delivers:

  * A report on all the new ICT solicitations for the previous day
  * A report of ICT solicitations flagged for manual review
  * A portal for agency SMEs to perform manual reviews of flagged solicitations
  * Trending data of flagged solicitations by agency and government-wide

## **Benefits of SRT**

As federal acquisition staff needs to ensure that ICT solicitation documents include Section 508 requirements. The SRT will make it easier to find those solicitations that have been identified as either compliant or non-compliant by:

  * Automating the review process
  * Ensuring accessibility requirements are properly defined in ICT solicitations
  * Influencing training offerings
  * Supporting IT Accessibility PMs
  * Improving GSA's ability to support agencies
  * Providing timely analytics

With SRT, agencies will have the information to inform decisions on which solicitations warrant additional Section 508 requirements, those that warrant amending the solicitations to add requirements before selection decisions are made by the agency.

## **How to Access SRT**

The SRT is available to agency procurement officials and Section 508 Program Managers by **sending a request to <srt@gsa.gov>**. Once approved, you will receive instructions for accessing the tool using a Login.gov account associated with your government email address (e.g., .gov or .mil).

If you have questions or suggestions for improving the tool, click the Contact Us link on the SRT homepage to message the system administrators.
