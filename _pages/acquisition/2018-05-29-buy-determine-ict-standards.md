title: 'Step 3: Determine Which Standards Apply'

To ensure that any technology your agency buys or builds will be accessible, you must determine which of the [Revised 508 Standards][1] apply to your Federal IT procurement and development project. (Note, this is the third and final step in [determining 508 standards and exceptions][2].)

Identify which Standards apply to each [information and communication technology](https://www.section508.gov/content/glossary/#ict) (ICT) item:

  * Select the type of ICT, then answer the questions
  * If your ICT item falls under a single category:
     * Select the category that best fits, and only answer those questions
  * If your ICT item spans multiple categories (e.g., a VOIP IP solution that includes both hardware and software):
     * Answer the questions under each relevant category
  * Record your responses in the [Revised 508 Standards Applicability Checklist][3] (MS-Word, April 2018)

Note, this step is not required if your entire ICT item is eligible for any of the exceptions (which you should have [determined in Step 2][4]), except the Best Meets exception. If only some components of the ICT item qualify for an exception, you must determine which Standards apply to the remaining components.
## **ICT Types**

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li>
    <a href="#0">Electronic Content</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#1">Software</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#2">Hardware</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0">
  <strong>Electronic Content</strong>
</h2>

**Question 1** - Is the content comprised of records maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) pursuant to Federal recordkeeping statutes?

  * If Yes, the electronic content component of the ICT item does not have to conform to the Revised 508 Standards.
    * If the ICT contains hardware or software components, proceed below to those sections, below.

  * If No, proceed to Question 2

**Question 2** - Will the content be public-facing?

  * If Yes, proceed to Question 4
  * If No, proceed to Question 3

All public facing electronic content must be accessible. The standards define ”public facing” as content made available by an agency to members of the general public. [Section E205 of the Revised 508 Standards][5] specifies which electronic content, including web, software, multimedia and electronic documents, must conform to the technical requirements. Usually, public facing content is published on the web (for example, on an agency website, blog, form, or social media page). However, public facing content might also be made available in non-web formats, such as information displayed on screens or interactive kiosks in waiting areas.

**Question 3** - Will the content be an official agency communication that is not public-facing?

  * If Yes, proceed to Question 4
  * If No, the electronic content component of the ICT item does not have to conform to the Revised 508 Standards.
    * If the ICT contains hardware or software components, proceed below to those sections.

Electronic content that is not public facing but is official business, and is communicated through one or more of the nine categories below is an ”agency official communication” and must be accessible. The content might be broadly disseminated or sent to individual agency employees or members of the public. The method of delivery does not determine whether electronic content is ”agency official communication.” Such content may be disseminated via an internal agency website or intranet, or by other delivery modes. Common transmittal means include, but are not limited to: emails, text messages, phone alerts, storage media, and downloadable documents.

The nine categories of agency official communication (with examples) are listed below. All of the following examples are provided to help provide further understanding of these categories. The examples are not all-inclusive. Contact the U.S. Access Board for assistance with interpreting and applying these categories.

  1. **Emergency notifications** - Examples include: evacuation notices, active shooter alerts, text messages conveying emergency instructions (e.g., ”remain in place”), hazardous weather alerts, and operational notices regarding unscheduled closures.
  2. **An initial or final decision adjudicating an administrative claim or proceeding** - Examples include: an electronic notice or alert of an approved, denied, or pending claim sent to a business or other organization, or to an individual.
  3. **Internal or external program or policy announcements** - For example, an electronic notification of a new agency policy or a change to an existing program requirement.
  4. **A notice of benefits, program eligibility, employment opportunity, or personnel action** - For example: an electronic notice sent to a member of the public or employee describing government benefits to which they are entitled; information on whether an individual is eligible for benefits from, or can participate in a government program; information on the status of an application for enrollment in a program; notification of an official personnel action indicating a promotion, adverse action, or other personnel decision affecting a government employee; a job announcement.
  5. **A formal acknowledgment of receipt** - For example: an email acknowledging receipt of payment; a notice posted to a program participant’s web page containing his or her personal account information and acknowledging that he or she successfully submitted certain records.
  6. **Survey questionnaires** - Examples include: a set of written questions (open-ended or multiple choice) developed for the purpose of a survey or data analysis such as a questionnaire assessing employee training needs; an employee satisfaction survey; a questionnaire used to gather information related to gauging satisfaction with a government program. This category does not include questions submitted during litigation or legal proceedings.
  7. **Templates or forms** - For example: an electronic document template used to create official agency documents or presentations; a web page template created to establish a common look and feel for a website; an official agency form that must be completed by employees or members of the public.
  8. **Educational or training materials** - Examples include: interactive online training courses; self-paced training course; educational webinars; other educational presentation formats; support materials for such activities including, electronic worksheets, training manuals, and tests. 
  9. **Intranet content designed as a web page** - For example: an intranet page listing files for downloading; shared calendars; an internal employee locator; and other html web pages distributed internally via an agency Intranet. This category does not include files within a listing distributed via the agency intranet that are not in one or more of the nine categories above.

NOTE: An exception provides that NARA is not responsible for remediating records sent to them by other agencies
