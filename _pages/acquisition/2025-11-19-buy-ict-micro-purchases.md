The <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Section 508 Standards</a> require that all federal government agencies make their information and communication technology (ICT) accessible to people with disabilities. Because of this, the process for buying and procuring new ICT has a series of steps to ensure that these standards are met.

However, for smaller purchases, like when a leader uses a government purchase card to get a new copy machine for an office, or a software used by a small team, not all steps of the procurement process are needed. These purchases instead follow a simplified process specifically for "micro-purchases"--ICT that is below a specific purchase threshold.

For a complete training on this topic, see the [Micro-Purchases and Section 508 Requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/training/online-course/micro-purchases/) course.

## What is Section 508?
### Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make their ICT accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible ICT interferes with a disabled person's ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily, and can prevent them from accessing necessary services and benefits.

Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, open new opportunities for people with disabilities, and encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. Additionally, the standards set by Section 508 enhance usability and improve the overall user experience for everyone, regardless of their abilities.

This standard applies to all Federal agencies and the U.S. Postal Service when they "develop, procure, maintain, or use" ICT.  Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.

Section 508 is a required standard and you are an important member of the team that supports these efforts in accessibility.

### Accessibility for All
Section 508 addresses accessibility for people with disabilities, including but not limited to disabilities that affect:

* Vision
* Hearing
* Perception of color
* Speech
* Manipulation, reach, and strength
* Language and cognitive abilities

Section 508 applies to all ICT products and services that you purchase, including small dollar purchases known as micro-purchases.

Use the standards and regulations in the following list any time you want to learn more about Section 508 and how you can support implementation.

## Micro-Purchase Definition
### What is a Micro-Purchase?
As defined in the <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101__d75e1704" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">FAR Subpart 2.1</a>:

<div class="grid-col-8 border-base padding-1 margin-x-auto border-y text-primary" style="width:85%;">
  <em>"A micro-purchase is an acquisition of supplies or services using simplified acquisition procedures, the aggregate amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold."</em>
</div>

In other words, when you buy ICT, and the "aggregate amount," or total cost, is under the micro-purchase threshold, the simplified micro-purchase requirements and processes apply, rather than the standard ICT procurement process.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  For most purchases, the purchase must cost less than $10,000 in total, because that is the default aggregate threshold.
</div>

Some purchases have a higher or lower threshold, depending on the type of purchase. For example, certain construction and services procurements have lower thresholds, and certain types of defense spending have higher thresholds.

Always check <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-2.1#FAR_2_101__d75e1704" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">FAR Subpart 2.1</a> for the current micro-purchase threshold information and any exceptions that may apply to your procurement.

If your purchase is above the aggregate threshold, you must follow the standard ICT Procurement Process. For more information about this process, review the resource [Buy Accessible Products and Services]({{site.baseurl}}/buy/).

### Micro-Purchases and Section 508
It is important that all Government employees responsible for purchasing ICT, such as Requiring Officials, Contracting Officers, Approving Officials, and other Government buyers are aware of their responsibilities regarding Section 508. Since the Government-wide commercial purchase card is the preferred method to buy goods and services that do not exceed the micro-purchase limit, this includes cardholders using a Government purchase card.

#### Requiring Officials
Anyone and everyone is or can be a Requiring Official. As soon as you decide you want to procure something, regardless of your grade level or position description, you become the "Requiring Official." For example, a secretary ordering a multipurpose machine or a Program Manager ordering a software application is a Requiring Official. As long as you are in the process of buying something or considering a purchase, you are a Requiring Official. Requiring Officials represent the actual customer side -- they "own" the need and requirements that will be met by the contract. If you are a Requiring Official you may have several different responsibilities where you need knowledge and understanding of the Section 508 Standards.

#### Government Buyers
A Government "Buyer" is given a written delegation to procure on behalf of the government and are the only individuals authorized to obligate the government for the purchase of goods and services (<a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-1.6#FAR_1_602_2__d55e12" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">FAR1.603-2</a> and <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/subpart-1.6#FAR_1_602_3__d56e10" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">FAR1.602-3</a>).

#### Approving Officials (AO)
In purchase card programs, the AO ensures that the purchase card is used properly. The AO authorizes cardholder purchases and ensures that the statements are reconciled and submitted to the designated billing office in a timely manner. The AO should also review proposed purchases to ensure that purchase cardholders comply with Section 508 requirements.

To do this, they must follow the procedures established by <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Issuance-of-Revised-Appendix-B-to-OMB-Circular-A-123.pdf" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">OMB Circular A 123 Appendix B, Improving the Management of Government Charge Card Programs (PDF)</a>.

## Micro-Purchase Process
### Process Overview
To comply with the FAR and Section 508, there are tasks you must perform when making a micro-purchase.

This micro-purchases process consists of six steps:

1.  Determine if your requirement is ICT.
2.  Determine which Section 508 standards apply to your requirement.
3.  Perform market research.
4.  Complete documentation.
5.  Perform any additional agency-specific procedures or requirements (such as receiving AO approval).
6.  Purchase your product or service.

    <h4 id="what-is-considered-ict">What is considered ICT?</h4>
    <p>Once you have determined your business need (the functionality you require), you must begin by determining if that need is considered ICT. ICT is defined by the U.S. Access Board:</p>
    <p>Information technology and other equipment, systems, technologies, or processes, for which the principal function is the creation, manipulation, storage, display, receipt, or transmission of electronic data and information, as well as any associated content.</p>
    <p>Examples of ICT include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Computers and peripheral equipment</li>
        <li>Information kiosks and transaction machines</li>
        <li>Telecommunications equipment</li>
        <li>Customer premises equipment</li>
        <li>Multifunction office machines</li>
        <li>Applications</li>
        <li>Websites</li>
        <li>Videos</li>
        <li>Electronic documents</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="functional-performance-criteria">Functional Performance Criteria</h4>
    <p>To be Section 508 conformant, ICT must be functional:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Without vision</li>
    <li>With limited vision</li>
    <li>Without perception of color</li>
    <li>Without hearing</li>
    <li>With limited hearing</li>
    <li>Without speech</li>
    <li>With limited manipulation</li>
    <li>With limited reach and strength</li>
    <li>With limited language, cognitive, and learning abilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#302-functional-performance-criteria" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Functional Performance Criteria</a> as outlined in the law.</p>

  <div id="m-b2" class="usa-accordion__content">
  <h4 id="what-section-508-standards-apply-">What Section 508 standards apply?</h4>
    <p>Once you have determined that your procurement is ICT, your next step is to determine which category of ICT it fits into. That category will define the Section 508 technical standards that you will use when evaluating potential products.</p>
    <p>As defined in <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">CFR Part 1194, Appendices A&amp;B</a>, there are four Section 508 technical standards categories:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Electronic content, including websites and agency communications</li>
    <li>Hardware</li>
    <li>Software</li>
    <li>Support documentation and services (i.e. help desk services)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="developing-section-508-requirements-for-procurements">Developing Section 508 requirements for procurements</h4>
    <p>The below tools and processes can help you conduct either a manual or automated review to define accessibility requirements for your solicitation. See <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Buy Accessible Products and Services</a> for more information on how to use these tools.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Option 1 - Build custom accessibility requirements using Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART). Use ART, which automates the Standards Applicability Checklist and generates customized language to build your accessibility requirements.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Option 2 - Manually determine accessibility requirements. Follow this step-by-step guidance on how to <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Determine 508 Standards and Exceptions</a> and complete the Standards Applicability Checklist. Use the 508 Standards and Exceptions Chart &amp; Examples template to clearly communicate which standards and exceptions apply to each item in a solicitation that includes ICT.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Failing to include the applicable Section 508 technical requirements increases the risk of your project going over budget, missing deadlines, or requiring remediation after the product has been delivered and accepted. Not developing Section 508 conformant deliverables also puts your agency at a higher risk of being sued.</p>
    <h4 id="request-accessibility-information-from-vendors-and-contractors">Request Accessibility Information from Vendors and Contractors</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Request Accessibility Information from Vendors and Contractors</a> page can help you determine the required standards for the ICT solution you intend to procure. Requirements will depend on whether the ICT is standard or customized. The page also includes a suggested process to help you determine and document the requirements and applicable exceptions.</p>
    <p>Determining Section 508 requirements is rather technical, so consult with <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">your agency Section 508 Program Manager</a> for assistance.</p>
    <h4 id="section-508-exceptions">Section 508 Exceptions</h4>
    <p>There are some <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">general exceptions</a> that pertain to Section 508:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Legacy ICT (Safe Harbor)</li>
    <li>National Security</li>
    <li>Federal Contracts (ICT that is incidental to a contract and won&#39;t be part of the delivered procurement)</li>
    <li>ICT Functions Located in Maintenance or Monitoring Spaces</li>
    <li>Undue Burden or Fundamental Alteration</li>
    <li>Best Meets (due to commercial non-availability). If there are technically acceptable solutions available in the marketplace, you need to select one of those solutions. You cannot choose a different solution and claim an exception (e.g., &quot;best meets&quot; or &quot;undue burden&quot;). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Micro-purchases rarely fall within these exceptions. If you are making a micro-purchase in one of these categories, consult <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">your Section 508 Program Manager</a> for assistance in properly documenting the exception.</p>

  <div id="m-b3" class="usa-accordion__content">
  <h4 id="market-research">Market Research</h4>
    <p>Once you know which Section 508 technical standards apply to your micro-purchase, you must perform market research to find possible solutions that could meet your business need. The goal of your market research is to find a Section 508 conformant product or service or decide which of the available products or services best meets the accessibility requirements.</p>
    <p>Maria must perform market research to find a vendor that offers a multifunction machine that conforms to all the applicable Section 508 technical standards for multifunction machines.</p>
    <h4 id="conducting-market-research">Conducting Market Research</h4>
    <p>Steps for conducting market research for accessible products are defined on the Section508.gov website in the <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Buy Accessible Products and Services, Market Research</a> section.</p>
    <p>To assess accessibility during the market research process, you may do any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Search the internet for existing Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACR) for the ICT being procured. These are often referred to as Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPATs®). A VPAT® is the industry standard template to be used for making product accessibility claims.</li>
    <li>Ask colleagues at your agency, or within relevant communities of practice.</li>
    <li>Visit the <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Acquisition Gateway</a> (requires an OMB MAX ID) and use the <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Solutions Finder</a>.</li>
    <li>Visit the Accessibility <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Communities of Practice</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on conducting market research, see <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">FAR Part 10</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="review-information-you-obtain">Review information you obtain</h4>
    <p>Next, review the information you obtain. For micro-purchases, this activity will primarily consist of gathering and comparing the ACR or VPAT® for the options you are considering. Your job here is to identify which option best meets the accessibility requirements you defined in Step 2.</p>
    <p>As a best practice, try to find at least two possible solutions, gather the ACRs/VPATs®, and compare their quality. The attention to detail in how a vendor documents the accessibility of their products is a great indicator of how well you can &#39;trust&#39; what is documented. As you review them, consider:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Is there a clear indication that the ACR was authored by a third party?</li>
    <li>Is there detailed information about the exact type of testing and what evaluation methods were used?</li>
    <li>Are there positive examples of how a product supports a specific success criterion?</li>
    <li>Does the vendor publicly display their ACR?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Excerpted from  <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">How to Read a VPAT®: Assessing Accessibility Conformance Reports</a>, Brian McNeilly, University of Washington, USA, Sina Bahram, Prime Access Consulting, Inc., USA</p>
    <h4 id="scoring-acrs">Scoring ACRs</h4>
    <p>ACRs include categories rated as &quot;meets&quot;, &quot;partially meets&quot;, and &quot;does not meet&quot; requirements. Assign a value to each of those ratings, then tally the scores, paying greatest attention to accessibility elements most pertinent to the requirements you defined in Step 2.</p>
    <p>Of the products that meet the business need, your agency is obligated to pick the item that meets Section 508 accessibility requirements. Document your research, to compare solutions and find one that is the best fit for your agency including at a minimum vendor name, version, and model number, and a description of how the solution will/will not meet your business need.</p>
    <p>Evaluating ACRs is not easy for a novice. Do not be afraid to seek help from <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">your Section 508 Program Manager</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="the-best-meets-exception">The Best Meets Exception</h4>
    <p>The &#39;Best Meets&#39; exception provides a mechanism to help agencies balance business needs and obligations to procure ICT and conform to the Revised Section 508 Standards when an alternative that fully conforms is not available.</p>
    <p>If there are technically acceptable solutions available in the marketplace, you must select one of those solutions (FAR 39.203(c)(1)). You cannot choose a different solution and claim an exception (such as &quot;best meets&quot; or &quot;undue burden&quot;).</p>
    <p>If your market research does not uncover any technically acceptable options, you can request an exception to procure a nonconformant solution. Of the alternatives that meet your business needs, you&#39;ll still need to select the alternative that best meets Section 508 requirements. You&#39;ll also need to provide documentation of your market research as justification.</p>
    <p>If the product is not accessible, you must determine an alternative way to provide access. The ICT must be accessible and usable by everyone. For example, if a supervisor couldn&#39;t find a multifunction machine that provided all necessary accessibility at the machine&#39;s touchpad, that machine would need to be equally accessible from a desktop application.</p>

    >Complete Documentation</button>
  </h3>
  <div id="m-b4" class="usa-accordion__content">
    <p>When you have selected the product that is the best fit for your agency, you must document your justification for the selected product and explain why other possible solutions were not chosen.</p>
    <p>If you believe an exception to Section 508 might apply, you must document in writing that your Section 508 PM or authorizing official has verified that an exception applies to your micro-purchase. If you purchase an ICT product or service that is not fully Section 508 conformant, you must document that you conducted adequate market research and provide a justification of your reasons for the purchase (such as the budget or mission). In addition, you must complete any documentation required by your agency.</p>
    <p>At a minimum, it is recommended that you keep a copy of your documentation AND provide a copy to all others involved in the procurement process, such as the AO and Contracting Officer.</p>
    <p>E202.7.1 Required Documentation - The responsible agency official must document in writing: The non-availability of ICT that fully conforms to the Standards, including a description of market research performed and which provisions cannot be met; and The basis for determining that the ICT to be procured best meets the Standards consistent with meeting agency business needs.</p>

    <p>While all agencies are required to adhere to Section 508, procedures may differ from one agency to another.</p>
    <p>As part of your role in the purchasing process, it is your responsibility to be aware of any agency-specific policies and procedures related to ICT micro-purchases and Section 508. If you are unsure of any agency-specific policies and procedures, check with your agency&#39;s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Procurement Officer, and <a href="https://training.section508.gov/508-training/courses/micro-purchase-new/lesson1/index.html">Section 508 Program Manager</a>.</p>
