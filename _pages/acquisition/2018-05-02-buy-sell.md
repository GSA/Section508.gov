All information and communication technology (ICT) procured, developed, maintained, or used by Federal agencies must be accessible. ICT includes software, hardware, electronic content, support documentation and services. 

If you'd like to **buy** ICT for the Federal government, you&rsquo;ll need to determine whether the product or service you wish to purchase meets the [Revised 508 Standards][1].

If you'd like to **sell** ICT to the Federal government, youâ€™ll need to show the government that your products and services are accessible.
