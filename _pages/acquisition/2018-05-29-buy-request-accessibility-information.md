When purchasing software, hardware, electronic content, or support documentation and services (known as information and communication technology, or ICT), clearly state your accessibility requirements up-front, so potential vendors and contractors (offerors) can propose the best solution for your needs. All ICT procured, developed, maintained, or used by Federal agencies must conform to the [Revised 508 Standards][1].

The information you should request from offerors will differ depending on whether the ICT item is _Standard_ or _Customized_.

  * **Standard ICT** - Commercial or government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS)
  * **Customized ICT** - Customized or developed based on agency requirements

## **Process Overview**

Follow this process to determine and document requirements and exceptions to the [Revised 508 Standards][1] for **EACH ICT item**:

**Step 1: Determine** whether the item is Standard or Customized ICT.

**Step 2: Identify** requirements and exceptions

  * Use the [Revised 508 Standards Applicability Checklist][2] (MS-Word, May 2018) to identify requirements and exceptions.
      * Complete a checklist for **EACH ICT item**.
      * [Determine 508 Standards and Exceptions][3] - Follow these step-by-step instructions guidance on how to complete the Checklist.

**Step 3: Document** requirements and exceptions

  * Use the [Applicable 508 Standards and Exceptions Chart - Template][4] (MS-Word, September 2017) to document requirements and exceptions.
      * You may want to complete a chart for each ICT item, and paste the chart(s) directly into your solicitation documentation.
      * See these instructions and examples on how to complete the [508 Standards and Exceptions Chart & Examples][5]

**Step 4: Explain** how offerors should respond

  * Provide written instructions to offerors on how to respond to the requirements you&rsquo;ve identified
      * Describe any additional items they should include in their report. Consider the acquisition size, complexity, and impact on users with disabilities, when determining which items are needed.
      * Clarify whether any, or all, requirements must be provided in order to be considered for award.
