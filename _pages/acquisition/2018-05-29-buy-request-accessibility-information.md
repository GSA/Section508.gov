When purchasing software, hardware, electronic content, or support documentation and services (known as information and communication technology, or ICT), clearly state your accessibility requirements up-front, so potential vendors and contractors (offerors) can propose the best solution for your needs. All ICT procured, developed, maintained, or used by Federal agencies must conform to the [Revised 508 Standards][1].

The information you should request from offerors will differ depending on whether the ICT item is _Standard_ or _Customized_.

  * **Standard ICT** - Commercial or government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS)
  * **Customized ICT** - Customized or developed based on agency requirements

## **Process Overview**

Follow this process to determine and document requirements and exceptions to the [Revised 508 Standards][1] for **EACH ICT item**:

**Step 1: Determine** whether the item is Standard or Customized ICT.

**Step 2: Identify** requirements and exceptions

  * Use the [Revised 508 Standards Applicability Checklist][2] (MS-Word, May 2018) to identify requirements and exceptions.
      * Complete a checklist for **EACH ICT item**.
      * [Determine 508 Standards and Exceptions][3] - Follow these step-by-step instructions guidance on how to complete the Checklist.

**Step 3: Document** requirements and exceptions

  * Use the [Applicable 508 Standards and Exceptions Chart - Template][4] (MS-Word, September 2017) to document requirements and exceptions.
      * You may want to complete a chart for each ICT item, and paste the chart(s) directly into your solicitation documentation.
      * See these instructions and examples on how to complete the [508 Standards and Exceptions Chart & Examples][5]

**Step 4: Explain** how offerors should respond

  * Provide written instructions to offerors on how to respond to the requirements you&rsquo;ve identified
      * Describe any additional items they should include in their report. Consider the acquisition size, complexity, and impact on users with disabilities, when determining which items are needed.
      * Clarify whether any, or all, requirements must be provided in order to be considered for award.

  * **Supplemental Accessibility Report (SAR)** - A written SAR containing:
      * Description of evaluation methods used to produce the ACR, to demonstrate due diligence in supporting conformance claims;
      * Documentation of features that help achieve accessibility and usability for persons with disabilities;

      * Information on the documentation available for authors on how the tool(s) can produce and validate accessible electronic content;

  * State that the agency reserves the right, prior to making an award decision, to perform testing on some or all of the offeror&rsquo;s proposed ICT items to ensure the accuracy of their response. State that if the agency requests the opportunity to perform hands-on testing, the offeror shall provide the following:
      * Final commercially available release versions in terms of functionality and features.
      * Accessibility Test Plan illustrating &rdquo;typical&rdquo; user scenarios and tasks to ensure fair and accurate testing of offered solutions. This test plan can be used to help the agency perform its testing of the ICT product or service being offered.

      * Upon award, any ICT product provided for testing by all unsuccessful offerors will be returned at the offeror&rsquo;s expense. The successful offeror&rsquo;s ICT product(s) will be kept and accounted for in any resultant order, if applicable.
