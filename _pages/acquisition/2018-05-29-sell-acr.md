An Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) is a document that explains how information and communication technology (ICT) products such as software, hardware, electronic content, and support documentation meet (conform to) the [Revised 508 Standards][1] for IT accessibility. ACRs help Federal agency contracting officials and government buyers to assess ICT for accessibility when doing market research and evaluating proposals.

Government solicitations which include ICT will specify accessibility requirements, indicating which provisions are required to ensure the deliverable is accessible. An ACR is a good way to address the accessibility requirements defined in the solicitation.

We recommend that vendors generate an ACR for any ICT that's intended to be marketed to the Federal government. Use the ACR to make specific statements in simple recommended language to demonstrate how the features and functional characteristics of your product meet the [Revised 508 Standards][1].
