# Why OpenACR

OpenACR is a modern and effective way for people to create, evaluate, and compare Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs). These reports are used to measure how well a digital product or service meets accessibility standards (such as those required by [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/about-us/)). The goal is to make sure people with disabilities can access government websites and services.

## The challenge

But there are problems with the way ACRs are typically created. In the procurement process, vendors often use a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) to provide information to buyers about how well their offering meets accessibility requirements. It is usually in a Word document or PDF, and often is not an accurate representation of product accessibility.

Traditional ACRs make it difficult to effectively evaluate accessibility because they are:

- Inconsistently structured (each one can look different, with no common standard)
- Private documents (hard to track down a specific ACR or get in touch with the writers)
- Not searchable (difficult to quickly locate specific information or requirements)
- Static (showing only a snapshot of accessibility at the time of ACR writing)
- Paper-based (with no way to easily update as the product evolves)

All of this makes it hard for evaluators to compare accessibility claims across multiple products, or even to be sure the ACR they are reading conforms to a validated standard. It's also tedious and difficult for the people tasked with writing the reports, which can result in poor quality information that is not useful to evaluators.

The whole process is disempowering to organizations that truly care about providing accessible services. Finding, sharing, and maintaining accurate data about product accessibility should be simple for everyone.

## The solution

OpenACR helps to solve these problems by providing a machine-readable, highly structured format that people can use to create modern, digital ACRs. It starts with a [step-by-step editor](https://gsa.github.io/openacr-editor/) that walks people through each part of the accessibility reporting process, and ends with a validated Accessibility Conformance Report that can be viewed as a YAML file or simply as a web page (HTML). Both of these formats are useful to the people responsible for evaluating accessibility conformance.

A conformance report generated through OpenACR is:

- Standardized (each is consistently structured and held to a baseline format)
- Findable (a public repository makes it easy to locate a report for any product)
- Searchable (saving time and resources for evaluators)
- Comparable (making it easier to see which solution best meets organizational needs)
- Updatable (version control allows the report to be updated as the product evolves)

OpenACR is built on existing standards for accessibility compliance.

- Addresses all conformance requirements from Section 508
- Reports are built using the VPATÂ® framework from the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) because it is widely recognized
- Aligns with specifications of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0

## Who benefits from OpenACR?

Bringing Accessibility Conformance Reports into the digital age helps everyone involved in choosing, building, and using government products.

Procurement officials can find, search, and compare accessibility reports (with greater confidence in their accuracy) Vendors can more easily create useful ACRs and keep them up to date Managers and team leaders can better understand which products may pose limitations to staff with disabilities Government organizations can reference and contribute to a growing library of ACRs that can serve as a reliable resource for everyone Agencies that test conformance claims can share their findings back to the vendors (improving the accuracy of that ACR) People with disabilities (and allies) will benefit from and can contribute to a process that actually works to enforce accessibility regulations and promote awareness

## Where did OpenACR come from?

OpenACR is an initiative by the General Services Administration (GSA) to modernize and standardize Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs). The vision is to improve the use and effectiveness of ACRs in evaluating accessibility of digital products, tools, and services.

This is an open source project that aims to create an open standard that can be continuously improved. Anyone is welcome to:
