**Best Practices for Creating and Maintaining a Vendor ACR & VPAT® Repository**

Federal agencies and procurement teams rely on vendors to provide clear, accurate, and up-to-date Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs), often in the form of a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®). A well-maintained Vendor ACR & VPAT® Repository ensures your ICT products remain accessible and competitive in the federal market. Below are best practices to help you create and maintain a high-quality repository for all ICT products available for acquisition.

### 1. Follow the Latest VPAT® Template
Use the latest VPAT® 2.4 (or the current version) to ensure compliance with:
- Revised Section 508 Standards (36 CFR Part 1194)
- WCAG 2.0/2.1 AA
- EN 301 549 (if applicable)
- W3C/WAI-ARIA standards

Make sure to complete each section fully, explaining both compliance and any limitations.

### 2. Be Transparent and Specific
- Clearly describe each success criterion and product behavior.
- Avoid vague language like “supports” without explanation.
- Include notes on alternative methods, known issues, and planned remediation.

### 3. Keep ACRs Updated
- Update your ACR after each major product release.
- Review documents annually to ensure accuracy.
- Maintain version control and date stamps on all reports.

### 4. Build a Centralized, Searchable Repository
- Host all ACRs in a publicly accessible location on your website.
- Organize by product name, version, and release date.
- Ensure the repository is easily searchable and filterable by criteria such as product category or compliance level.

### 5. Include Contact Information
- Provide a designated accessibility contact.
- Encourage agencies to reach out for clarification or additional documentation.

### 6. Maintain Internal Review Processes
- Establish regular internal audits of ACR quality.
- Engage third-party accessibility consultants for complex products.
- Train product managers and technical writers on accessibility reporting standards.

### 7. Proactively Communicate Changes
- Notify agencies and procurement contacts of updated ACRs.
- Include revision history logs within the repository.

### 8. Ensure Your Repository is Itself Accessible
- Use accessible document formats (PDF/UA or HTML).
- Provide keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for your repository.

### Conclusion
By following these best practices, you can demonstrate a strong commitment to accessibility, support federal buyers’ compliance requirements, and ensure your ICT products remain attractive in the federal acquisition space.
