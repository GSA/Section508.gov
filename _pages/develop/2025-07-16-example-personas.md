The law requires that we take the needs of today's users and the needs of future users into account. So how do we do that? Well, there is such a wide spectrum of disabilities, it would be an impossible task to cater requirements to the needs of every single individual person. That's why, in design and development, it's helpful to categorize users with similar needs into "personas".

## Blind Users

A blind user does not have the ability to see. These users use an Assistive Technology called a Screen Reader to navigate web content. These users do not use a mouse because they cannot see the mouse pointer. Instead, they use a keyboard to navigate on desktop or gestures to navigate a touch screen.

### A Blind User Needs...

- Interactive controls to be keyboard accessible  
- Interactive controls to be named and described in text  
- Instructions on how to use non-native, non-intuitive interactive controls  
- Meaningful colors to be provided in text  
- The visual cues of elements that change state upon interaction to be described in text  
- Alternative text descriptions of meaningful images and icons  
- Audio descriptions of video content when important information is provided visually  

### A Blind User Expects...

- A logical focus order  
- Focus to be sent to new interactive content that dynamically appears  
- To be notified of new content when new information/notifications dynamically appear  
- Semantic page structures, such as headings, lists, and regions, to skim content and jump to desired sections  
- To understand a data table's name and structure (column names)

A low vision user has significantly reduced vision that interferes with daily living and cannot be fully corrected by glasses.

### A Low Vision User Needs...

- Highly visible and high contrast indications of visible focus  
- High contrast for text and interactive interfaces  
- Instructions on how to use non-native, non-intuitive interactive controls  
- To enlarge text sizes and images using the browser zoom function  
- Audio descriptions of video content when important information is provided visually  

### A Low Vision User Expects...

- Minimalist and efficient screen layouts  
- Related items to be near each other  
- Interactive controls to be keyboard accessible  
- Focus to be sent to new interactive content that dynamically appears  
- To be notified of new content when new information/notifications dynamically appear  
- To be able to linearize page content

## Low Mobility Users

In the context of a web application, a Low Mobility User has difficulty using their fingers, hands, or may not have hands. These users may use a keyboard to use the web or they may use an Assistive Technology called Dictation Controlled AT. They may not have the ability to accurately click or touch web interfaces that are small.

### A Low Mobility User Needs...

- Interactive controls to be keyboard accessible  
- To be warned about system auto-timeouts at least 20 seconds prior to the time out and provided an option to keep working  

### A Low Mobility User Expects...

- The touch/click areas of interactive controls to be at least 24 by 24 pixels  
- Interactive elements to have their associated on-screen label text be programmatically associated  
- Custom interactive components to behave similarly to native HTML elements
