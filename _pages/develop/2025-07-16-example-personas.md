Web content managers have many considerations when it comes to publishing content to their domains. First, there are a few action items to consider before readying the content to post. We have included these actions in the pre-publishing checklist below. Some of the actions should be done sequentially, while others can be done independently. However, all items from the pre-publishing checklist should be completed prior to publishing.

## Accessibility Personas
The law requires that we take the needs of today's users and the needs of future users into account.  So how do we do that? Well, there is such a wide spectrum of disabilities, it would be an impossible task to cater requirements to the needs of every single individual person. That's why, in design and development, it's helpful to categorize users with similar needs into "personas".

<ol>
    <h2>Blind Users</h2>
    A blind user does not have the ability to see. These users use an Assistive Technology called a Screen Reader (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, Talkback) to navigate web content. These users do not use a mouse because they cannot see the mouse pointer. Instead, they use a keyboard to navigate on desktop or gestures to navigate a touch screen.
    <h3>A Blind User Needs...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Interactive controls to be keyboard accessible</li>
  <li>Interactive controls to be named and described in text</li>
  <li>Instructions on how to use non-native, non-intuitive interactive controls</li>
  <li>Meaningful colors to be provided in text</li>
  <li>The visual cues of elements that change state upon interaction to be described in text</li>
  <li>Alternative text descriptions of meaningful images and icons</li>
  <li>Audio descriptions of video content when important information is provided visually</li>
</ul>
    <h3>A Blind User Expects...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A logical focus order</li>
  <li>Focus to be sent to new interactive content that dynamically appears
</li>
  <li>To be notified of new content when new information/notifications dynamically appear</li>
<li>Semantic page structures, such as headings, lists, and regions, to skim content and jump to desired sections
</li>
  <li>To understand a data table's name and structure (column names)</li>
   <h2>Low Vision Users</h2>
    A low vision user has significantly reduced vision that interferes with daily living and cannot be fully corrected by glasses. These users may use an Assistive Technology called a Magnifier (ZoomText) and may also use Screen Reader (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, Talkback) to navigate web content. Most low vision users do not use a mouse because they have difficulty seeing the mouse pointer. Instead, they may prefer a keyboard to navigate on desktop or gestures to navigate a touch screen. </p>

<p><h3>A Low Vision User Needs...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Highly visible and high contrast indications of visible focus</li>
  <li>High contrast for text and interactive interfaces</li>
  <li>Instructions on how to use non-native, non-intuitive interactive controls</li>
  <li>To enlarge text sizes and images using the browser zoom function</li>
  <li>Audio descriptions of video content when important information is provided visually</li></ul>
  <p><h3>A Low Vision User Expects...</h3><ul>
  <li>Minimalist and efficient screen layouts</li>
  <li>Related items to be near each other
</li>
  <li>Interactive controls to be keyboard accessible
</li>
  <li>Focus to be sent to new interactive content that dynamically appears
</li>
  <li>To be notified of new content when new information/notifications dynamically appear
</li>
<li>To be able to linearize page content</li>
</p>
    </li></ul>
    <h2>Color Blind Users</h2>
    A color blind user cannot see the full spectrum of colors and has difficulty distinguishing colors. The most common form of color blindness is called Protanopia, which makes the colors red and green look the same.

<h3>A Color Blind User Needs...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High contrast for text</li>
  <li>High contrast for interactive interfaces
</li>
  <li>Meaningful colors to be provided in screen text or by using a different icon for each color which represents the meaning</li></ul>
   <h2>Deaf and Partial Hearing Users</h2>
    A Deaf user does not have the ability to hear. A Partial Hearing user has a significantly reduced ability to hear. </p>

<p><h3>A Deaf and Partial User Needs...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Text transcripts for audio-only content
</li>
  <li>High contrast for text and interactive interfaces</li>
  <li>Synchronized captioning and text transcripts for video
</li>
  <li>Interpretive services for live events and remote meetings
</li></ul>
  <p><h3>A Deaf and Partial User Needs...</h3><ul>

</li>
  <li>Interpretive services for live events and remote meetings
</li>
</p></ul><p>
<h3>A Partial Hearing User Needs...</h3><ul>
<li> Audio to be loud, high quality, volume adjustable, and absent of background noises</li></ul>

  <h2>Deaf and Partial Hearing Users</h2>

<h3>A Partial Hearing User Needs...</h3>
<ul><li> Audio to be loud, high quality, volume adjustable, and absent of background noises</li></p></ul>
<h2>Low Mobility Users</h2>
In the context of a web application, a Low Mobility User has difficulty using their fingers, hands, or may not have hands. These users may use a keyboard to use the web or they may use an Assistive Technology called Dictation Controlled AT (Dragon). They may not have the ability to accurately click or touch web interfaces that are small.

<h3>A Low Mobility User Needs... </h3><ul>
<li> Interactive controls to be keyboard accessible</li>
<li> To be warned about system auto-timeouts at least 20 seconds prior to the time out and provided an option to keep working </li></ul>

<h3>A Low Mobility User Expects... </h3>
<ul><li> The touch/click areas of interactive controls to be at least 24 by 24 pixels</li>
<li> Interactive elements to have their associated on-screen label text be programmatically associated</li>
<li> Custom interactive components to behave similarly to native HTML elements</li></ul>

<p><h2> Language, Cognitive, and Developmentally Delayed Users </h2></p>Language, Cognitive, and Developmentally Delayed Users have difficulty with mental tasks such as reading, comprehension, memory, and computation.</p>

<h3>A Language, Cognitive, or Developmentally Delayed User Needs... </h3><ul>
<li> To be notified of changes of context or non-disruptive changes</li>
<li> To be warned about system auto-timeouts at least 20 seconds prior to time out and provided an option to keep working </li></ul>

<h3>A Language, Cognitive, or Developmentally Delayed User Expects... </h3>
<ul><li> Simple, plain language
</li>
<li> Minimalist and efficient screen layouts</li>
<li> Text to not be in all CAPS
</li>
<li>Sans-serif fonts</li><li>Paragraphs of text to be left aligned
</li>
</ul>
