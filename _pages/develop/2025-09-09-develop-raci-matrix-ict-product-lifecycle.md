A RACI matrix provides a clear framework to define and assign [roles and responsibilities]({{site.baseurl}}/manage/roles/) at each phase of the product lifecycle. By outlining who is **R**esponsible, **A**ccountable, **C**onsulted, and **I**nformed, the matrix ensures ICT accessibility considerations are systematically incorporated from planning and design through testing and deployment. This structured approach promotes collaboration among stakeholders, reduces the risk of accessibility oversights, and supports adherence to <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Section 508 Standards</a> throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Roles:

* PM \= Project Manager  
* BA \= Business Analyst or Requirements Analyst  
* UX/UI \= User Experience or User Interface Designer  
* DEV \= Developer  
* QA \= ICT Accessibility QA or Test Engineer  
* Section 508 SME \= Section 508 Subject Matter Expert  
* CA \= Content Author

## Legend:

* **R \= Responsible** – The person or team who completes the task.  
* **A \= Accountable** – The person who is ultimately responsible for the task’s success. They ensure the work is correct and give final approval.  
* **C \= Consulted** – People who provide input or expertise.They are asked for advice or knowledge before decisions are made.  
* **I \= Informed** – People who are kept updated on the task’s progress. They don’t take part in the work but need to know the status.
