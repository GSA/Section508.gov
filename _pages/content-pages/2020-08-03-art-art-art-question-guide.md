      Overview
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      The Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART) is a web-based application that helps you properly document IT accessibility requirements in contracting documents. If your procurement includes information and communication technology (ICT) products and/or services, ART helps you determine which Section 508 requirements apply. You’ll receive a comprehensive report detailing the technical criteria that apply to your procurement, including functional performance criteria (if applicable) and exceptions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      ART will walk you through a series of questions about your procurement, beginning with potential exceptions. If no exceptions apply, ART will walk you through the criteria for each item in your procurement, then produce a report containing all the applicable standards and exceptions that apply to your procurement. This document provides guidance on questions ART asks in the following areas:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exceptions;
      </li>
      <li>
        Hardware;
      </li>
      <li>
        Electronic content;
      </li>
      <li>
        Software; and
      </li>
      <li>
        ICT support products and services.

      Tooltips
    </h1>
    
    <p>
      As you move through the tool, you will see <strong>red icons with an “i,” </strong>depicted in Figure 1 below. These are <strong>Tooltips</strong>, and you can find them for every question in ART. Tooltips provide chapter titles, numbers, and text from the technical criteria and/or Section 508 exceptions that relate to the current question. Tooltips help you understand the significance of a question as it relates to the Section 508 requirements for your procurement. You will also see <strong>green square icons with an “i”</strong> on them in Figure 2 below. These are second level tool tips that provide additional details and examples. To access the tooltips, hover over the icons with your mouse, or tab to them using your keyboard.

      Required questions are marked with an asterisk (*). The answers you provide for each question will determine which exceptions or technical criteria apply to your procurement, and which follow-up questions you receive on the form.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you answer “Yes” or “I don’t know” to the first question, you will be prompted to answer questions related to <strong>General Exceptions </strong>(as seen below). These procurement-level exceptions may or may not apply to you. Each potential exception has a specific number of related exceptions and/or technical criteria, which are shown in both the text above each question, and in the Tooltip. Tooltips are discussed in the next section.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you select “Yes” for any of the questions on the page shown in Figure 4, the justification text box will display at the bottom of the page, and all component-level questions will be skipped.

        Exceptions
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Alternative Means (E202.6.3). </strong> Where ICT that fully conforms to the Revised 508 Standards is not commercially available, and where conformance to one or more requirements in the Revised 508 Standards imposes an undue burden or a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT, the agency shall provide individuals with disabilities access to and use of information and data by an alternative means that meets identified needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Basis for a Determination of Undue Burden (E202.6.1). </strong> In determining whether conformance to requirements in the Revised 508 Standards would impose an undue burden on the agency, the agency shall consider the extent to which conformance would impose significant difficulty or expense considering the agency resources available to the program or component for which the ICT is to be procured, developed, maintained, or used.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Best Meets (E202.7). </strong> Where ICT conforming to one or more requirements in the Revised 508 Standards is not commercially available, the agency shall procure the ICT that best meets the Revised 508 Standards consistent with the agency’s business needs
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Federal Contracts (E202.4). </strong> ICT acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract shall not be required to conform to the Revised 508 Standards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - ICT Functions Located in Maintenance or Monitoring Spaces (E202.5).</strong> Where status indicators and operable parts for ICT functions are located in spaces that are frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair, or occasional monitoring of equipment, such status indicators and operable parts shall not be required to conform to the Revised 508 Standards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Legacy ICT (E202.2). </strong> Any component or portion of existing ICT that complies with an earlier standard issued pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (as republished in Appendix D), and that has not been altered on or after January 18, 2018, shall not be required to be modified to conform to the Revised 508 Standards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) Exception. </strong> Agency historically valuable records that are not public facing only need to be made accessible if they become public facing AFTER the agency transfers legal custody of the records to NARA for permanent preservation in the National Archives of the United States. In that case, NARA is responsible for making the records accessible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - National Security (E202.3). </strong> The Revised 508 Standards do not apply to ICT operated by agencies as part of a national security system, as defined by 40 U.S.C. 1103(a).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Required Documentation (E202.6.2). </strong> The responsible agency official shall document in writing the basis for determining that conformance to requirements in the Revised 508 Standards constitute an undue burden on the agency, or would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT. The documentation shall include an explanation of why and to what extent compliance with applicable requirements would create an undue burden or result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Required Documentation (E202.7.1). </strong> The responsible agency official shall document in writing: (a) the non-availability of conforming ICT, including a description of market research performed and which provisions cannot be met, and (b) the basis for determining that the ICT to be procured best meets the requirements in the Revised 508 Standards consistent with the agency’s business needs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception - Undue Burden or Fundamental Alteration (E202.6). </strong> Where an agency determines in accordance with E202.5 that conformance to requirements in the Revised 508 Standards would impose an undue burden or would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT, conformance shall be required only to the extent that it does not impose an undue burden, or result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the ICT.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Exception related to User Preferences (E503.2). </strong> The exception under 503.2 User Preferences applies to applications (like Flash) that are not controlled by their platform (in the case of Flash, its platforms are the browser and the OS). Recalling the original Section 508 and Trusted Tester methodology, Flash was tested as software and it failed when Windows high contrast settings were not adopted. Under the Revised 508 Standards, Flash would fall under this exception as it is isolated from both the browser and OS. Another scenario would be when accessing software that resides on another computer. The remote application would not need to allow the local platform settings to adjust its appearance.
