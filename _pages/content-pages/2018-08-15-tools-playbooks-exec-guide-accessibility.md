      The Federal government strives to deliver a level of service comparable to that of the best private sector organizations, and as more government services move online, we have a responsibility to ensure equal access to those services, particularly for the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html" target="_blank">1 in 4 US adults - 61 million Americans - living with a disability</a>&nbsp; All information technology (IT) purchased, built, maintained or used by U.S. Federal agencies is required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to be accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the legal requirements, accessibility is good for business. Creating products and information that everyone can use drives innovation, provides a better customer experience, and improves employee engagement. Accessibility helps you reach more stakeholders and, ultimately, achieve your agency&rsquo;s mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Executive support for accessible IT is essential to increase compliance with Federal policy, and help agencies deliver a digital customer experience that is accessible to all. Drawn from successful practices in both government and the private sector, this guide aims to help Federal CIOs and senior executives improve the accessibility of Federal IT, through advocacy, strong governance, and appropriate resourcing of accessibility business functions.

<h2 id="benefits">
  Benefits
</h2>

Better accessibility supports many areas of information assurance, including security and privacy. Accessible websites are easier to maintain, inherently mobile-friendly, and retain customers by delivering a better customer experience. When we design IT systems to be accessible from the outset, we avoid having to make expensive retrofits to comply with policy, and reduce the risk of customer complaints and costly lawsuits. In addition, accessible and easy-to-use technology solutions can improve public perception of government.

  * [Benefits of Accessible Design][1] include more customers, cost savings, and innovation.

  Legal Considerations
</h2>

### The Law

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended in 1998, is a Federal law that requires equal access for individuals with disabilities to technology funded or provided by the Federal government. **This law applies to all IT the Federal government buys, builds, maintains, and uses.** Access should be comparable to that of individuals who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

  * [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act][3]

### The Standards

The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Final Standards and Guidelines (also known as the [Revised 508 Standards][4]) are the technical requirements and criteria used to measure conformance with Section 508. Non-compliance can result in time-consuming and costly lawsuits, delayed implementation of key IT investment priorities, and damage to public mission or image.

  Conclusion
</h2>

IT Accessibility is a team effort that requires strong support from agency leaders, and participation across the entire agency. With the right &ldquo;coach,&rdquo; Federal agencies can build a culture that values the importance of equal access, staff will understand their responsibilities related to accessibility, and we can work together to produce digital products and services that meet the needs of all Americans.
