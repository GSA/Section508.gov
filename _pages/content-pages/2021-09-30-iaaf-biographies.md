      <em><span>International Disability Rights Activists</span></em><br /><span>Judith Heumann, LLC<br />Former Special Advisor for International Disability Rights, Department of State (2010-2017)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Judith (Judy) Heumann is a lifelong advocate for the rights of disabled people. She contracted polio in 1949 in Brooklyn, New York and began to use a wheelchair for her mobility. She was denied the right to attend school because she was considered a "fire hazard" at the age of five. Her parents played a strong role in fighting for her rights as a child, but Judy soon determined that she, working in collaboration with other disabled people, had to play an advocacy role due to continuous discrimination.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>She is now an internationally recognized leader in the disability rights community. Her memoir, authored with Kristen Joiner, of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Being-Heumann-Unrepentant-Disability-Activist/dp/0807019291" class="session-link"><em>Being Heumann</em>“Being Heumann: An Unrepentant Memoir of a Disability Rights Activist</a>,” published by Beacon Press and audio recorded by Ali Stroker, who is the first wheelchair actor to perform on Broadway. Judy was featured on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybcQbpSVo3c" class="session-link">Daily Show with Trevor Noah</a>. Judy is featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs0VRfOg7Wo&t=8s" class="session-link">Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution</a> is a 2020 American award winning documentary film, directed by James LeBrecht and Nicole Newnham, produced by the Obama Higher Ground Production and is available on Netflix. She also produces a podcast called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0CYpP8LB2wZ8vUM93DnINF?si=wXgpTq8lT6OXxSkkEINhbA" class="session-link">The Heumann Perspective</a>, which features a variety of members from the disability community.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>She has been featured in numerous documentaries including on the history of the disability rights movement, including <a href="https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/lives-worth-living/" class="session-link">Lives Worth Living</a> and the Power of 504 and delivered a TED talk in the fall of 2016, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/judith_heumann_our_fight_for_disability_rights_and_why_we_re_not_done_yet?language=en" class="session-link">“Our Fight for Disability Rights- and Why We’re Not Done Yet”</a>. Her story was also told on Comedy Central’s Drunk History in early 2018, in which she was portrayed by Ali Stroker. As <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/4276/judyheumann_report_2019_final.pdf" class="session-link">Senior Fellow at the Ford Foundation (2017-2019)</a>, she wrote <em>“Road Map for Inclusion: Changing the Face of Disability in Media”</em>. She also currently serves on a number of non-profit boards, including the American Association of People with Disabilities, the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, Humanity and Inclusion, as well as the Human Rights Watch board.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Judy was a founding member of the Berkeley Center for Independent Living which was the first grassroots center in the United States and helped to launch the Independent Living Movement both nationally and globally.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>In 1983, Judy co-founded the World Institute on Disability (WID) with Ed Roberts and Joan Leon, as one of the first global disability rights organizations founded and continually led by people with disabilities that works to fully integrate people with disabilities into the communities around them via research, policy, and consulting efforts.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>From 1993 to 2001, Judy served in the Clinton Administration as the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in the Department of Education.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Judy then served as the World Bank's first Adviser on Disability and Development from 2002 to 2006. In this position, she led the World Bank's disability work to expand its knowledge and capability to work with governments and civil society on including disability in the global conversation.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>During his presidency, President Obama appointed Judy as the first Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the U.S. Department of State, where she served from 2010-2017.  Mayor Fenty of D.C. appointed her as the first Director for the Department on Disability Services, where she was responsible for the Developmental Disability Administration and the Rehabilitation Services Administration.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>She has been instrumental in the development and implementation of legislation, such as Section 504, the Individuals with Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which have been advancing the inclusion of disabled people in the US and around the world and fighting to end discrimination against all those with disabilities.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Judy graduated from Long Island University in Brooklyn, NY in 1969 and received her Master’s in Public Health from the University of California at Berkeley in 1975. She has received numerous awards including being the first recipient of the Henry B. Betts Award in recognition of efforts to significantly improve the quality of life for people with disabilities and the Max Starkloff Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Council on Independent Living. She has been awarded numerous honorary doctorates.</span>

    <p>
      <em><span>Section 508 Program Manager, National Cancer Institute (NCI)</span></em><br /><span>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Gary M.  Morin joined the National Cancer Institute’s Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) as their Section 508 Coordinator in March 2020.  In this capacity, he oversees Section 508 policies, governance, training, 508 procurement processes throughout the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Gary supports NCI staff in making its wide array of digital contents more accessible for employees and for members of the public.  He supports staff who are producing ICT products as well as those in contracting to ensure that their acquisition documents are inclusive of Section 508 requirements.  Prior to joining NCI in March 2020, he similarly functioned as NIH’s Section 508 and accessible ICT guru, based in NIH’s Office on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) (2001 – 2008) and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (2008 - 2020).
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Gary joined the NIH as a Sign Language Interpreter, in 1993.  Throughout the 1990s, he coordinated NIH interpreting services and he trained ASL interpreters across the US to facilitate communication in healthcare settings.  He was also actively involved with HHS’s Shared Neutrals, mediating conflict resolution in agencies across the Federal government, with an emphasis on reasonable accommodations.  With the onset of Section 508, he quickly saw and embraced the potential of accessible of Information and Communication Technology.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Gary sees the role of accessible technology as a means of enabling employees with disabilities to perform to their greatest potential and as part of an institutional responsibility and strategy to address healthcare disparities experienced by persons with disabilities.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is more than a law – it’s a means to address barriers to employment and to better healthcare outcomes.  Since the law’s implementation, he has been one of NIH’s few agency-wide subject matter experts for the coordination and implementation of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended, and its integration with both business ICT and digital content, as well as the role of assistive technology (AT).</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Gary is Vice-Chair of ABILITIES, NIH’s employee resource group for persons with disabilities and allies; he is equally active with the NIH Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing community.  For the last couple of years, he has also become more and more fascinated with audio-description and is now involved in the American Council of the Blind’s Audio Description Project and sits on the ADP’s Section 508 subcommittee.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Outside of the NIH, he finds great joy spending time with his 4-year-old granddaughter, seeks dead people in family history research, and loves a good film noir or classic, black-and-white horror flic.  His most recent recognition includes NIH EDI’s 2020 NIH Champions and Allies of Disability Awardees and NIH EDI’s 20 profiles for 2020: Celebrating LGBT community Diversity at NIH and Beyond.</span>

<p>
      <em><span>Professor and Director of the Trace R&D Center</span></em><br /><span>University of Maryland Trace Center</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Gregg Vanderheiden is a Professor in the School of Information Studies (iSchool) at the University of Maryland, College Park, and Director of the Trace Research & Development Center at the University of Maryland. Dr. Vanderheiden is the principal investigator of the Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Information Technology Access, and a co-principal investigator for the RERC on Telecom Access funded by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. Dr. Vanderheiden has been working in the area of access to technology for over 47 years. He was a pioneer in the field of Augmentative Communication (a term taken from his writings in 1979). He then worked with the computer industry in getting them to build disability access features directly into their standard products. For example, access features developed by Dr. Vanderheiden and his team have been built into the Apple’s Macintosh OS since 1987, IBM’s OS/2 and the UNIX X Window system since 1993. 9 of the first 10 access features built into Windows 95 (and subsequently 98, NT, 2000, Vista, Windows 7, 8, and 10) were licensed (royalty free) from Dr. Vanderheiden and his team.</span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>With the explosion in information and telecommunication technologies, and their increased importance in employment, education, and daily living, Dr. Vanderheiden and the Trace Center focused on building access into public information technologies. Recent achievements include co-chairing and co-authoring the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, and development of the EZ™ Access techniques for providing cross-disability access in electronic products of all types. He has worked with over 50 companies, and his work is reflected in phones, computers, over 80,000 accessible ATMs, 60,000 Point of Sale terminals, and 20,000+ cross-disability accessible Automated Postal Stations of the USPS, the Amtrak ticket machines, and kiosks in memorials, museums and airline terminals. </span>
    </p>
<p>
      <span>Dr. Vanderheiden served on the FCC's Technological Advisory Council, was a member of the Telecommunications Access Advisory committee and the Electronic Information Technology Access Advisory Committee for the US Access Board, and served on the steering committee for the National Research Council's Planning Group on "Every Citizen Interfaces," co-authoring the National Research Councils, More Than Screen Deep Report. He also served on the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Disability in America, the National Task Force on Technology and Disability, and the National Academies’ IOM committee on the Future of Disability in America. He is a past President of RESNA - the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, and a Founding Fellow of the American Institute of Medical & Biological Engineering (AIMBE).</span>
