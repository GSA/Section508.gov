## About IAAF 2020

The 2020 Interagency Accessibility Forum celebrated the 75th observance of the National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA). Inspirational keynote speakers included: the honorable Congressman Jim Langevin, Chair of the Bipartisan Disability Caucus; Thomas Harkin, former United States Senator and author and chief Senate sponsor of the ADA; Janet Dhillon, Chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and Paula Briscoe, Deputy Director, Intelligence Community Equal Employment and Diversity for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

Virtual panel discussions focused on three areas: Customer Experiences & Content Creation, Acquisition & Program Management, and Innovation--in the federal government and internationally. In addition, the forum included a virtual Exhibitor Round-Robin where 24 accessibility consultants and/or IT companies with accessibility programs gave a five minute demonstration of their products and services that support those with disabilities.

The 2020 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) was sponsored by the Federal Chief Information Officer Council&rsquo;s (Federal CIO Council) Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) and hosted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program from the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) of the General Services Administration (GSA) and the U.S. Census Bureau, in partnership with other federal agencies.
