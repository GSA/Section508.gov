Definition of Deliverable

Below is a definition of cloud computing from National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information Technology Laboratory (Peter Mell and Tim Grance, Version 15, 10-7-09 <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/index.html>):

"Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model promotes availability and is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.

Essential Characteristics:

  * On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service's provider.
  * Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).
  * Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, and virtual machines.
  * Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.
  * Measured Service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

Service Models:

  * Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.
  * Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.
  * Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).

Deployment Models:

  * Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.
  * Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premise or off premise.
  * Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.
  * Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).

Note: Cloud software takes full advantage of the cloud paradigm by being service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability."

The standards for connecting the computer systems and the software needed to make cloud computing work are not fully defined at present time, leaving many companies to define their own cloud computing technologies. Systems offered by companies, like IBM's "Blue Cloud" technologies for example, are based on open standards and open source software which link together computers that are used to deliver Web 2.0 capabilities like mash-ups or mobile commerce. (<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cloud_computing.html" class="ext" target="_blank">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/c/cloud_computing.html</a>)

Security is a main concern for government. There is a need to verify security at a level greater than NIST Security Level 1 (Low) before there will be widespread use of Cloud Computing.

Cloud Computing may involve a dedicated server, telecommunications products, computers and computer hardware, but these are additional EIT deliverables that require Government Product Accessibility Templates.

  Computer-based Training
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 86000000 (segment) Education and Training Services
  * 43232500 Educational or reference software 
      * 43232502 Computer based training software

Definition of Deliverable

"Computer-Based Trainings (CBTs) are self-paced learning activities accessible via a computer or handheld device. CBTs typically present content in a linear fashion, much like reading an online book or manual. For this reason they are often used to teach static processes, such as using software or completing mathematical equations. The term Computer-Based Training is often used interchangeably with Web-based training (WBT) with the primary difference being the delivery method. Where CBTs are typically delivered via CD-ROM, WBTs are delivered via the Internet using a web browser. Assessing learning in a CBT usually comes in the form of multiple choice questions, or other assessments that can be easily scored by a computer." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-based\_training#Computer-Based\_Training][1])

1194.21 Software and operating system requirements apply to the means of training delivery.

In addition, if training information is intended to be made available in a multimedia format by the agency, Section 508 must be considered as a requirement on the delivered content to assure that it considers the specific Section 508 accessibility requirements detailed in Section 1194.24.

If acquisition of telecommunications products or information kiosks or computer hardware is required to deliver the training these are additional EIT deliverables requiring their own Government Product Accessibility Templates.

Definition of Deliverable

Computer monitors are defined below: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor" class="ext">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor</a>)

"A monitor or display (sometimes called a visual display unit) is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry, and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) thin panel, while older monitors use a cathode ray tube about as deep as the screen size.

The first computer monitors used Cathode ray tubes (CRTs), which was the dominant technology until they were replaced by LCD monitors in the 21st Century.

Originally, computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment. From the 1980s onwards, computers (and their monitors) have been used for both data processing and entertainment, while televisions have implemented some computer functionality. The common aspect ratio of televisions, and then computer monitors, has also changed from 4:3 to 16:9."

Definition of Deliverable

Printers are defined below. (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_printers>)

"In computing, a printer is a peripheral which produces a hard copy (permanent readable text and/or graphics) of documents stored in electronic form, usually on physical print media such as paper or transparencies. Many printers are primarily used as local peripherals, and are attached by a printer cable or, in most newer printers, a USB cable to a computer which serves as a document source. Some printers, commonly known as network printers, have built-in network interfaces (typically wireless and/or Ethernet), and can serve as a hardcopy device for any user on the network. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network connected users at the same time. In addition, a few modern printers can directly interface to electronic media such as memory sticks or memory cards, or to image capture devices such as digital cameras, scanners; some printers are combined with a scanners and/or fax machines in a single unit, and can function as photocopiers. Printers that include non-printing features are sometimes called Multifunction printers (MFP), Multi-Function Devices (MFD), or All-In-One (AIO) printers. Most MFPs include printing, scanning, and copying among their features.)"

Most computer printers include driver software and some, for example dye sublimation photo printers include application software. Both driver and application software must conform to applicable Section 508 Standards from Section 1194.21, even if they are not actually used.

Maintenance for Computer Printers includes driver and application software updates and must conform to applicable Section 508 Standards from Section 1194.21, even if they are not actually used.

      * 43211515 Computer workstation

Definition of Deliverable

Wikipedia lumps the definition of desktop and portable computers into personal computers (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer>)

"A personal computer (PC) is any general-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and original sales price make it useful for individuals, and which is intended to be operated directly by an end user, with no intervening computer operator. This is in contrast to the batch processing or time-sharing models which allowed large expensive mainframe systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time, or large data processing systems which required a full-time staff to operate efficiently.

A personal computer may be a desktop computer, a laptop, tablet PC or a handheld PC (also called palmtop). The most common microprocessors in personal computers are x86-compatible CPUs. Software applications for personal computers include word processing, spreadsheets, databases, Web browsers and e-mail clients, games, and myriad personal productivity and special-purpose software. Modern personal computers often have high-speed or dial-up connections to the Internet, allowing access to the World Wide Web and a wide range of other resources."

Desktop and personal computers are one major Technical Section (1194.26) of the Standard, but frequently overlooked is that these computers typically come with software and operating systems and are therefore subject to Section 1194.21 Software and operating systems. Portable computers generally include both input devices such as keyboards, keypads, and touchscreens, and monitors as integral components. Requirements for portable computer input devices and monitors are included in this analysis. But, it should be noted that only a few portable computer monitors include internal television tuners. If keyboards and monitors are purchased with desktop computers, these should be considered as separate EIT deliverables.

Maintenance for Desktop or Portable Computer includes driver and application software updates and must conform to applicable Section 508 Standards from Section 1194.21.

Maintenance for Portable Computers covers keyboards, keypads, touchscreens, stylus, pencils, etc., typically included as a feature in portable computers.

Maintenance for Portable Computers covers monitors included with portable computers.

  Digital Camera
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 45121504 Digital Cameras

Definition of Deliverable

Wikipedia's definition for a digital camera is below. "A digital camera (or digicam for short) is a camera that takes video or still photographs, or both, digitally by recording images via an electronic image sensor.

Many compact digital still cameras can record sound and moving video as well as still photographs.

Digital cameras can do things film cameras cannot: displaying images on a screen immediately after they are recorded, storing thousands of images on a single small memory device, recording video with sound, and deleting images to free storage space. Some can crop pictures and perform other elementary image editing." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera>)

Digital cameras contain embedded software that can perform a variety of image processing functions. In addition, digital cameras often come with software that can be loaded on a computer for use in image processing camera images that must conform to Section 508, even if there is no intention of using it.

<h3 class="term-heading">
  eBooks
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 55111500 Electronic publications and music

There are three Quick Links associated with eBooks: eBooks (this Quick Link) or publications in digital form, dedicated eBook Readers that come with eBook Reader Software, and eBook Reader Software that is designed to be used on a personal computer, PDA or smartphone.

An electronic book (also e-book, ebook, digital book) is a book-length publication in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, and produced on, published through, and readable on computers or other electronic devices… Sometimes the equivalent of a conventional printed book, e-books can also be born digital. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines the e-book as "an electronic version of a printed book,".. but e-books can and do exist without any printed equivalent. E-books are usually read on dedicated hardware devices known as e-Readers or e-book devices. Personal computers and some cell phones can also be used to read e-books. (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book>) For this Quick Link, eBooks refers only to the software format for publication, not eBook software or eBook devices. EBooks typically include a web-based user interface with subscription or free eBook providers.

Note: eBooks are moving toward a free open standard format called ePUB (electronic publication). ePub version 2.0.1 uses XHTML 1.1 to render the content of the eBbook. eBooks published in the ePUB format are subject to technical provisions included in Section 1194.22 Web-based Internet and Intranet Information and Applications and 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria. eBooks published in proprietary formats are only subject to 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria. eBook Content in proprietary formats, however, should be subject to technical requirements similar to 14 technical requirements included in 1194.22 (see Summary) to meet these Functional Performance Criteria.

<!--------------------------------------------->

<h3 class="term-heading">
  eBooks Reader
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 43211509 Tablet computers

There are three Quick Links associated with eBooks: eBooks or publications in digital form, dedicated eBook Readers (this Quick Link) that come with eBook Reader Software, and eBook Reader Software that is designed to be used on a personal computer, PDA or smartphone. Dedicated eBook Readers and eBook Software used with other devices connect to subscription or free web service that provides information in the form of eBooks.

"An e-book reader, also called an e-book device or e-reader, is a portable electronic device that is designed primarily for the purpose of reading digital books and periodicals.

An e-book reader is similar in form to a tablet computer. A tablet computer typically has a faster screen capable of higher refresh rates which makes them more suitable for interaction. The main advantages of e-book readers are better readability of their screens especially in bright sunlight and longer battery life. This is achieved by using electronic paper technology to display content to readers. Any device that can display text on a screen can act as an e-book reader, but without the advantages of the e-paper technology." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison\_of\_e-book_readers][2])

There are three Quick Links associated with eBooks: eBooks or publications in digital form, dedicated eBook Readers that come with eBook Reader Software, and eBook Reader Software (this Quick Link) that is designed to be used on a personal computer, PDA or smartphone. Dedicated eBook Readers and eBook Software used with other devices connect to subscription or free web service that provides information in the form of eBooks.

"There is a wide variety of eBook (presentation) software available on a wide variety of formats. The most popular formats for commercial eBooks include PDF, MOBI, LIT, and eReader roughly in that order. (ePUB is a new emerging standard format.) … If you add dedicated eBook Readers then you would have to add BBeB, … and .. AZW to the list of popular formats." ([https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_software][3] ).

Most eBook applications include a web-based user interface, while some use standard web browsers. In addition, some eBook software includes word processing functions for authoring eBooks.

Definition of Deliverable

A facsimile (fax) machine, "processes the contents (text or images) [of scanned, printed material] as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones.." (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax>)

Internet or "online faxing" sends and receives document facsimiles via an Internet connection usually with a Web interface. No special equipment or software beyond computers, printers, and a Web browser are required. Fax machines may come with driver software. This software, whether it is used or not, is subject to Section 508 requirements, specifically 1194.21 Software Applications and Operating Systems.

<h3 id="G" class="term-heading">
  GPS Navigation Device
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 52161518 Global positioning system receivers

Definition of Deliverable

"A GPS navigation device is any device that receives Global Positioning System (GPS) signals for the purpose of determining the device's current location on Earth. GPS devices provide latitude and longitude information, and some may also calculate altitude, although this is not considered sufficiently accurate or continuously available enough (due to the possibility of signal blockage and other factors) to rely on exclusively to pilot aircraft. GPS devices are used in military, aviation, marine and consumer product applications. GPS devices may also have additional capabilities such as:

  * containing all types of maps, like streets maps, which may be displayed in human readable format via text or in a graphical format
  * providing suggested directions to a human in charge of a vehicle or vessel via text or speech
  * providing directions directly to an autonomous vehicle such as a robotic probe
  * providing information on traffic conditions (either via historical or real time data) and suggesting alternative directions
  * providing information on nearby amenities such as restaurants, fueling stations, etc.

In other words, all GPS devices can answer the question "Where am I?", and may also be able to answer:

- which roads or paths are available to me now?  
- which roads or paths should I take in order to get to my desired destination?  
- if some roads are usually busy at this time or are busy right now, what would be a better route to take?  
- where can I get something to eat nearby or where can I get fuel for my vehicle?  
- the shortest route between two locations…

Consumer GPS navigation devices include:

- Dedicated GPS navigation devices  
- GPS modules that need to be connected to a computer to be used  
- GPS loggers that record trip information for download. Such GPS tracking is useful for trailblazing, mapping by hikers and cyclists, and the production of geocoded photographs.  
- Converged devices, including GPS Phones and GPS cameras, in which GPS is a feature rather than the main purpose of the device. Those devices are the majority and may use assisted GPS or standalone (not network dependent) or both. The vulnerability of consumer GPS to radio frequency interference from planned wireless data services is controversial." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS\_navigation\_device][4]) 



This Quick Link is for Dedicated GPS navigation systems. Dedicated devices are typically two types, either handheld or devices intended for use in automobiles. GPS that are used in automobiles can be either mobile or a permanently installed component. Mobile automotive GPS systems can be used outside the car.

Definition of Deliverable

Service deliverables relevant to Section 508 considerations are EIT Information Content, Custom EIT Products and EIT-related Labor Hours. Accessibility considerations for Custom EIT Products are the same as for COTS products.

The EIT-related service deliverables in this Quick Link include contractor provided management, operation, maintenance and/or support of government Internet and intranet services. The difference between this Quick Link and the Web Application Quick Link is that in this case the agency is not buying a specific COTS product. One of the services an agency can buy is a development product, which would be the same as the Quick Link for a COTS product, but there are also other services included in this Quick Link, including Web hosting, web-mail services, etc. Although the applicable provisions are the same in the Quick Links for Web Applications and for Internet/Intranet Services, the recommended solicitation language is different.

Finally, cloud computing is an Internet/Intranet Service, but there is a separate Quick Link specifically for Cloud Computing because of its increasing importance to federal agencies.

  IP Telephones
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 43191511 IP phones

Definition of Deliverable

This Quick Link refers only to IP phones. Traditional phones and cell phones are the subject of other Quick Link s. In addition, Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), VoIP, and wireless telephone services are the subject of other Quick Links . In addition,. As the Access Board states, "Federal procurement officials need to understand that each product in the transmission path must be examined for compliance with this provision. The overall telecommunications system (both services and hardware) must be selected to ensure that valid signals will not be corrupted along the way to the user." ([https://www.access-board.gov/ict/guide/telecom_tutorial.html][9])

Different types of "telephones" and telephone services have proliferated in recent years. Wireless phones have all but replaced traditional telephones deliver communication over wires. "Voice over IP (VoIP) is a general term for a family of transmission technologies for delivery of voice communications over IP networks such as the Internet or other packet-switched networks. Other terms frequently encountered and synonymous with VoIP are IP telephony, Internet telephony, voice over broadband (VoBB), broadband telephony, and broadband phone." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice\_over\_IP][5]). VoIP includes both Softphones and PC-based VoIP. Softphones look very much like traditional phones, but use the Internet or private IP Networks to communicate. PC-based VoIP uses a computer's microphone and speakers or headset to communicate. In addition, PC-based and Softphone-bases systems can interoperate.

  Keyboards and Keypads
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 43211700 Computer data input devices 
      * 43211706 Keyboards
      * 43211713 Touch pads

Definition of Deliverable

Three different types of Computer Input Devices are the Subject of Quick Links: Keyboards (including Keypads); Pointing Devices; and, Video and Imaging Input Devices . Keyboards are the subject of this Quick Link.

A definition of Computer Input Devices from Wikipedia is below. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input\_device#High-degree\_of\_freedom\_input_d...][6]) "An input device is any peripheral (piece of computer hardware equipment) used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system (such as a computer)."

A definition of keyboards is from Wikipedia is below. (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_%28computing%29>)

"In computing, a keyboard is an input device, partially modeled after the typewriter keyboard, which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs (characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or computer commands."

Keypads are defined in two ways by the Merriam-Webster dictionary:

* "A small set of keys that is part of a larger keyboard or another device (such as a telephone or calculator)" (<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keypad>)
* "a small, usually numerical keyboard" (<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keypad>)

  Management Information System Services
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 81111700 Management information system services 
      * 81111703 Electronic data interchange EDI design
      * 81111704 Database design
      * 81111705 Systems architecture

Definition of Deliverable

Service deliverables relevant to Section 508 considerations are EIT Information Content, Custom EIT Products and EIT-related Labor Hours. Accessibility considerations for Custom EIT Products are the same as for COTS products.

The EIT-related service deliverables included in this Quick Link are contractor provided management, operation, and/or support of government management information systems.

According to Wikipedia ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management\_information\_systems][7])

"An MIS is a planned system of the collecting, processing, storing and disseminating data in the form of information needed to carry out the functions of management. In a way it is a documented report of the activities that were planned and executed."

<h3 class="term-heading">
  Mobile Application
</h3>

Definition of Deliverable

A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. Apps are usually available through application distribution platforms, which began appearing in 2008 and are typically operated by the owner of the mobile operating system, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Windows Phone Store, and BlackBerry App World. Some apps are free, while others must be bought. Usually, they are downloaded from the platform to a target device, such as an iPhone, BlackBerry, Android phone or Windows Phone, but sometimes they can be downloaded to laptops or desktop computers. For apps with a price, generally a percentage, 20-30%, goes to the distribution provider (such as iTunes), and the rest goes to the producer of the app. 1 The same app can therefore cost the average Smartphone user a different price depending on whether they use iPhone, Android, or BlackBerry 10 devices.

The term "app" is a shortening of the term "application software". (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app>)

  Multifunction Machines and Maintenance
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 44101500 Duplicating Machines 
      * 44101503 Multifunction Machines

Definition of Deliverable

A multifunctional machine or multifunctional printer (MFP) "is an office machine which incorporates the functionality of multiple devices in one, so as to have a smaller footprint…or to provide centralized document management/distribution/production in a large-office setting. A typical MFP may act as a combination of some or all of the following devices: Printer, Scanner, Photocopier, Fax, E-mail" (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer>)

Multifunctional machines typically include driver software and some come with application software to support advanced functionality such as optical character recognition, photo editing, etc. Both driver software and application software would be subject to Section 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems, even if there is no intention of using the application software.

Maintenance for Multifunction Machine includes both driver and application software updates and must conform to applicable Section 508 Standards from Section 1194.21, even if they are not actually used.

Definition of Deliverable

Three different types of Computer Input Devices are the Subject of Quick Links: Keyboards; Pointing Devices; and, Video and Imaging Input Devices . Pointing Input Devices are the subject of this Quick Link.

A definition of Computer Input Devices from Wikipedia is below. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input\_device#High-degree\_of\_freedom\_input_d...][6])

"An input device is any peripheral (piece of computer hardware equipment) used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system (such as a computer)."

Further, Pointing Devices are defined in Wikipedia as:

"A pointing device is any human interface device that allows a user to input spatial data to a computer. In the case of mice and touch screens, this is usually achieved by detecting movement across a physical surface. Analog devices, such as 3D mice, joysticks, or pointing sticks , function by reporting their angle of deflection. Movements of the pointing device are echoed on the screen by movements of the cursor, creating a simple, intuitive way to navigate a computer's GUI."

Definition of Deliverable

Wikipedia (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_instrument>) describes Scientific Instruments as follows:

"A Scientific Instrument can be any type of equipment, machine, apparatus or device …to facilitate or enable the pursuit, acquisition, transduction and storage of repeatable, verifiable data, usually consisting of sets numerical measurements made upon otherwise unknown, unproven quantities, properties, phenomena, materials, forces or etc., preferably as those characterized over time by an increasing degree of accuracy and precision and, typically, those initially derived as isolated or dependent variable results from, or empirical observations made during, the course of such experimental procedures as are firmly based upon the scientific method and long accepted tenants of experimental design.

Scientific Instruments are part of laboratory equipment, but are considered more sophisticated and more specialized than other measuring instruments as scales, meter sticks, chronometers, thermometers or even power or waveform generators. They are increasingly based upon the integration of computers to improve and simplify control, enhance and extend instrumental functions, conditions, parameter adjustments and data sampling, collection, resolution, analysis (both during and post-process), storage and retrieval. Individual instruments can also be connected as a local area network (LAN) and can be further integrated as part of a laboratory information management system (LIMS), that in addition to having Internet access to databases of such physical properties as compound spectra libraries through the World Wide Web for results comparisons and advanced data analysis as well as the obvious usefulness of now ubiquitous email for rapid exchange of informational text and images, consultation and peer review."

If a scientific instrument is integrated with a computer or a monitor, the computer (and associated operating system) and the monitor would be separate EIT deliverables, requiring their own Government Product Accessibility Templates (GPAT). If the computer included application software, this software would be another EIT deliverable requiring its own GPAT.

  Server
</h3>

UNSPSC Code:

  * 43211500 Computers 
      * 43211501 Computer servers
      * 43211502 High end computer servers

Definition of Deliverable

"…a server is any combination of hardware or software designed to provide services to clients. When used alone, the term typically refers to a computer which may be running a server operating system, but is commonly used to refer to any software or dedicated hardware capable of providing services." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_%28computing%29>) "…server computer, a computer dedicated for server applications

  * Application server, a server dedicated to running certain software applications
  * Communications server, carrier-grade computing platform for communications networks
  * Database server …
  * Fax server, provides fax services for clients
  * File server, provides file services
  * Game server, a server that video game clients connect to in order to play online together
  * Home server, a server for the home
  * Newsreader server, a server that feeds Usenet groups to client Newsreaders
  * Name Server or DNS server
  * Print server, provides printer services
  * Proxy server, provides database server in services
  * Sound server, provides multimedia broadcasting / streaming.
  * Standalone server, an emulator for client-server (web-based) programs
  * Web server, a server that HTTP clients connect to in order to send commands and receive responses along with data contents
  * Web Feed Server, a server that distributes, manages, and tracks internal and external RSS feeds in an enterprise
  * Client-server, a software architecture that separates "server" functions from "client" functions
  * The X Server, part of the X Window System
  * Peer-to-peer, a network of computers running as both clients and servers
  * Catalog server, a central search point for information across a distributed network"
  * (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server>)

Server computers are often mistakenly considered as "back office" exceptions from Section 508 requirements. In general, server hardware is part of the back office as it is located in "spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance, repair, or occasional monitoring". However, servers have operating systems and application software that interacts with the user. Further, computer hardware is more than occasionally frequented. It is no much different than a desktop computer.

      * 43191501 Mobile phones

Definition of Deliverable

"A smartphone is a mobile phone offering advanced capabilities, often with PC-like functionality (PC-mobile handset convergence). There is no industry standard definition of a smartphone. For some, a smartphone is a phone that runs complete operating system software providing a standardized interface and platform for application developers. For others, a smartphone is simply a phone with advanced features like e-mail, Internet and e-book reader capabilities, and/or a built-in full keyboard or external USB keyboard and VGA connector. In other words, it is a miniature computer that has phone capability." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone>)

Smartphones may be purchased with a telecommunications services package. The services offered, therefore, are also subject to additional requirements within Section 1194.23 Telecommunications products.

Smartphones typically include software applications (such as browsers) and operating systems. Maintenance of Smartphone includes any new, modifications, patches, updates, etc to software applications and operating systems that are explicitly included in the maintenance SOW.

Smartphones can also include Webapps. Maintenance of Smartphone will include any new, modifications, patches, updates, etc to webapps that are explicitly included in the maintenance SOW.

Smartphones include telecommunications functions. Maintenance of Smartphone will cover telecommunication services that were procured with Smartphones

Many Smartphones are essentially PDAs with telecommunications functions. Maintenanace will cover Section 1194.26.

Definition of Deliverable

"Application software, also known as an application or an app, is computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. Examples include enterprise software, accounting software, office suites, graphics software and media players. Many application programs deal principally with documents. Applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software, or may be published separately. In recent years, the abbreviation "app" has specifically come to mean application software written for mobile devices, with the abbreviation in particular representing both the smaller size and smaller scope of the software (i.e. an app whose sole purpose is to display an image representation of the current weather). Application software is contrasted with system software and middleware, which manage and integrate a computer's capabilities, but typically do not directly apply in the performance of tasks that benefit the user. The system software serves the application, which in turn serves the user."  
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software>)

"An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function."  
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system>)

The accessibility requirements for either application software or operating system software are the same.

Definition of Deliverable

"In computing, a device driver or software driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. A driver typically communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a routine in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware-dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface."

Service deliverables relevant to Section 508 considerations are EIT Information Content, Custom EIT Products and EIT-related Labor Hours. Accessibility considerations for Custom EIT Products are the same as for COTS products.

The EIT-related service deliverables included in this Quick Link are contractor provided management, operation, and/or support of government software applications or operating systems. The scope of software development and programming activities covered by the Section 508 standard is evident in the list of UNSPC services above. Software development and programming are related but not the same. Wikipedia provides a good discussion of the roles and differences between software developers and programmers.

"A software developer is a person or organization concerned with facets of the software development process. They can be involved in aspects wider than design and coding, a somewhat broader scope of computer programming or a specialty of project managing including some aspects of software product management. This person might contribute to the overview of the project on the application level rather than component level or individual programming tasks. …

A **programmer** is responsible for writing source code, but a **developer** could be involved in wider aspects of the software development process such as:

  * Participation in software product definition, including business case or gap analysis
  * Specification
  * Requirements analysis
  * Development and refinement of throw-away simulations or prototypes to confirm requirements
  * Feasibility and Cost-benefit analysis, including the choice of application architecture and framework, leading to the budget and schedule for the project
  * Design
  * Implementation (e.g. installation, configuration, programming/customization, integration, data migration)
  * Authoring of documentation needed by users and implementation partners etc.
  * Testing, including defining/supporting acceptance testing and gathering feedback from pre-release testers
  * Participation in software release and post-release activities, including support for product launch evangelism (e.g. developing demonstrations and/or samples) and competitive analysis for subsequent product build/release cycles
  * Maintenance" (

Definition of Deliverable

This Quick Link refers only to Traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS). Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and wireless telephone service are the subject of other Quick Links . In addition, telephones, both traditional and IP phones are also the subject of Quick Links . As the Access Board states, "Federal procurement officials need to understand that each product in the transmission path must be examined for compliance with this provision. The overall telecommunications system (both services and hardware) must be selected to ensure that valid signals will not be corrupted along the way to the user." (<https://www.access-board.gov/ict/guide/telecom_tutorial.html>)

"Plain old telephone service (POTS), which is the voice-grade telephone service that remains the basic form of residential and small business service connection to the telephone network in most parts of the world. The name is a retronym, and is a reflection of the telephone service still available after the advent of more advanced forms of telephony such as ISDN, mobile phones and VoIP. POTS has been available almost since the introduction of the public telephone system in the late 19th century, in a form mostly unchanged to the normal user despite the introduction of Touch-Tone dialing, electronic telephone exchanges and fiber-optic communication into the public switched telephone network (PSTN)."

Definition of Deliverable

This Quick Link refers only to VoIP. Traditional Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), and wireless telephone service are the subject of other Quick Links. In addition, telephones, traditional, cell, and IP phones are also the subject of Quick Links . As the Access Board states, "Federal procurement officials need to understand that each product in the transmission path must be examined for compliance with this provision. The overall telecommunications system (both services and hardware) must be selected to ensure that valid signals will not be corrupted along the way to the user." ([https://www.access-board.gov/ict/guide/telecom_tutorial.html][9])

"Voice over IP (VoIP) is a general term for a family of transmission technologies for delivery of voice communications over IP networks such as the Internet or other packet-switched networks. Other terms frequently encountered and synonymous with VoIP are IP telephony, Internet telephony, voice over broadband (VoBB), broadband telephony, and broadband phone." ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice\_over\_IP][5]). VoIP includes both Softphones and PC-based VoIP. Softphones look very much like traditional phones, but use the Internet or private IP Networks to communicate. PC-based VoIP uses a computer's microphone and speakers or headset to communicate. In addition, PC-based and Softphone-bases systems can interoperate.

VoIP is a telecommunications service, if telecommunications products, such as IP phones, Webcams, microphones, headphones or IP telephones are also needed, these products are additional deliverables that require their own Government Product Accessibility Templates.

      * 45111901 Audioconferencing systems
      * 45111902 Videoconferencing systems

Definition of Deliverable

According to Wikipedia (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videoconferencing#Standards>) video teleconferencing typically includes both audio and video teleconferencing systems:

"A videoconference or video teleconference (also known as a videoteleconference) is a set of interactive telecommunication technologies which allow two or more locations to interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simultaneously. It has also been called 'visual collaboration' and is a type of groupware.

Videoconferencing differs from a videophone calls in that its designed to serve a conference rather than individuals. It is an intermediate form of videotelephony, first deployed commercially by AT&T during the early 1970s using their Picturephone technology. …

The core technology used in a videoteleconference (VTC) system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labelled packets, which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind (usually ISDN or IP). The use of audio modems in the transmission line allow for the use of POTS, or the Plain Old Telephone System, in some low-speed applications, such as videotelephony, because they convert the digital pulses to/from analog waves in the audio spectrum range.

The other components required for a VTC system include:
  * Video input : video camera or webcam
      * Video output: computer monitor, television or projector
      * Audio input: microphones, DVD player, cassette player, or any other source of PreAmp audio outlet.
      * Audio output: usually loudspeakers associated with the display device or telephone
      * Data transfer: analog or digital telephone network, LAN or Internet

There are basically two kinds of VTC systems:
<ol>
<li>Dedicated systems have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment, usually a console with a high quality remote controlled video camera. These cameras can be controlled at a distance to pan left and right, tilt up and down, and zoom. They became known as PTZ cameras. The console contains all electrical interfaces, the control computer, and the software or hardware-based codec. Omnidirectional microphones are connected to the console, as well as a TV monitor with loudspeakers and/or a video projector. There are several types of dedicated VTC devices: 
<ol>
<li>Large group VTC are non-portable, large, more expensive devices used for large rooms and auditoriums.</li>
<li>Small group VTC are non-portable or portable, smaller, less expensive devices used for small meeting rooms.</li>
<li>Individual VTC are usually portable devices, meant for single users, have fixed cameras, microphones and loudspeakers integrated into the console.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Desktop systems are add-ons (hardware boards, usually) to normal PCs, transforming them into VTC devices. A range of different cameras and microphones can be used with the board, which contains the necessary codec and transmission interfaces. Most of the desktops systems work with the H.323 standard. Videoconferences carried out via dispersed PCs are also known as e-meetings."
</li>
</ol>

Video teleconferencing systems typically involve both software and Web applications. Maintenance for Video-Teleconferencing includes any new, modifications, patches, updates, etc to software applications, drivers and web-applications that are explicitly included in the maintenance SOW.

Definition of Deliverable

"…A web application or webapp is an application that is accessed via a web browser over a network such as the Internet or an intranet. The term may also mean a computer software application that is hosted in a browser-controlled environment (e.g. a Java applet) or coded in a browser-supported language (such as JavaScript, possibly combined with a browser-rendered markup language like HTML) and reliant on a common web browser to render the application executable…. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis and many other functions." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application>)

This Quick Link refers to computer off-the-shelf COTS web applications. Custom web applications are included in the Quick Link for Internet and Intranet Services .

The range of possible web apps is in theory the same as software applications. In fact, web apps are currently much more limited, but with developments in Cloud Compu ting, the scope of web apps are likely to dramatically increase. Further, webapps often include software applications, such as Browsers, Plug-ins, extensions, etc, then 1194.21 Software and operating systems applies and should be included in the Government Product Accessibility Template.

Webapps can also include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Any telecommunications hardware or service needed to support VoIP would require its own Government Product Accessibility Template.

Web Application Maintenance applies to any new, modifications, patches, updates, etc to software applications that are explicitly included in the maintenance SOW.

Web Application Maintenance applies to any new, modifications, patches, updates, etc to video and multi-media productions that are explicitly included in the maintenance SOW.

Definition of Deliverable

"Web conferencing is used to conduct live meetings, training, or presentations via the Internet. In a web conference, each participant sits at his or her own computer and is connected to other participants via the internet. This can be either a downloaded application on each of the attendees' computers or a web-based application where the attendees access the meeting by clicking on a link distributed by e-mail (meeting invitation) to enter the conference.

A webinar is a neologism to describe a specific type of web conference. It is typically one-way, from the speaker to the audience with limited audience interaction, such as in a webcast. A webinar can be collaborative and include polling and question & answer sessions to allow full participation between the audience and the presenter. In some cases, the presenter may speak over a standard telephone line, while pointing out information being presented onscreen, and the audience can respond over their own telephones, speaker phones allowing the greatest comfort and convenience. There are web conferencing technologies on the market that have incorporated the use of VoIP audio technology, to allow for a completely web-based communication. Depending upon the provider, webinars may provide hidden or anonymous participant functionality, making participants unaware of other participants in the same meeting…

Other typical features of a web conference include:

  * Slide show presentations - where PowerPoint or Keynote slides are presented to the audience and markup tools and a remote mouse pointer are used to engage the audience while the presenter discusses slide content.
  * Live or Streaming video - where full motion webcam, digital video camera or multi-media files are pushed to the audience.
  * VoIP (Real time audio communication through the computer via use of headphones and speakers)
  * Web tours - where URLs, data from forms, cookies, scripts and session data can be pushed to other participants enabling them to be pushed though web based logons, clicks, etc. This type of feature works well when demonstrating websites where users themselves can also participate.
  * Meeting Recording - where presentation activity is recorded on the client side or server side for later viewing and/or distribution.
  * Whiteboard with annotation (allowing the presenter and/or attendees to highlight or mark items on the slide presentation. Or, simply make notes on a blank whiteboard.)
  * Text chat - For live question and answer sessions, limited to the people connected to the meeting. Text chat may be public (echo'ed to all participants) or private (between 2 participants).
  * Polls and surveys (allows the presenter to conduct questions with multiple choice answers directed to the audience)
  * Screen sharing/desktop sharing/application sharing (where participants can view anything the presenter currently has shown on their screen. Some screen sharing applications allow for remote desktop control, allowing participants to manipulate the presenters screen, although this is not widely used.)

Web conferencing is often sold as a service, hosted on a web server controlled by the vendor. Offerings vary per vendor but most hosted services provide a cost per user per minute model, a monthly flat fee model and a seat model. Some vendors also provide a server side solution which allows the customer to host their own web conferencing service on their own servers." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing>)

  Web-based Information, Documentation and Support
</h3>

&nbsp;

Definition of Deliverable

Information, documentation and support (1194.41) should also apply to any EIT solicitation. Information, documentation and support can be provided in four (4) basic formats:

  * Help desk or call center (oral)
  * Printed material (e.g., paper documents)
  * Electronic material (e.g., electronic documents, DVD)
  * Web access (including any web-based applications).

Overall, the following guidelines for information, documentation and support should always be considered:

  * Vendors generally provide support for EIT deliverables even if such support is not requested by the agency. This support must meet appropriate accessibility requirements. This support is often in the form of web-based information and documentation. Training and other support information may also be provided using video and multimedia productions.
  * Paper material should be made available in alternate accessible electronic formats upon request, at no additional charge.

Service deliverables generally include information and documentation in the form of reports. Since these reports are shared in electronic formats, either as email attachments or posted on internal and/or external websites, all electronic documents should be accessible.

Definition of Deliverable

Web-based training or "Virtual courses … are courses delivered on the Internet [or intranet]. "Virtual" is used here to characterize the fact that the course is not taught in a classroom face-to-face but through some substitute mode that can be associated with classroom teaching.

A virtual program (or a virtual course of studies) is a study program in which all courses or at least a significant portion of the courses are virtual courses. …Many virtual study programs are mainly text based, using HTML, PowerPoint, or PDF documents. Multimedia technologies have been investigated for many years and eventually found their way into practice. Today a wide spectrum of instruction modes is available, including the following:

&nbsp;

  * Virtual Classroom: A virtual classroom is a learning environment created in the virtual space. The objectives of a virtual classroom are to improve access to advanced educational experiences by allowing students and instructors to participate in remote learning communities using personal computers; and to improve the quality and effectiveness of education by using the computer to support a collaborative learning process. The explosion of the knowledge age has changed the context of what is learnt and how it is learnt - the concept of virtual classrooms is a manifestation of this knowledge revolution.
  * Hypertext courses: Structured course material is used as in a conventional distance education program. However, all material is provided electronically and can be viewed with a browser. Hyperlinks connect text, multimedia parts and exercises in a meaningful way.
  * Video-based courses are like face-to-face classroom courses, with a lecturer speaking and PowerPoint slides or online examples used for illustration. A video-streaming technology is used. Students watch the video by means of freeware or plug-ins (e.g. Windows Media Player, RealPlayer)….
  * Animated courses: Enriching text-oriented … material by animations is generally a good way of making the content and its appearance more interesting. Animations are created using Macromedia Flash or similar technologies. These animations help understand key concepts and also allow for better retention of learning.
  * Web-supported textbook courses are based on specific textbooks. Students read and reflect the chapters by themselves. Review questions, topics for discussion, exercises, case studies, etc. are given chapterwise on a website and discussed with the lecturer. Class meetings may be held to discuss matters in a chatroom, for example.
  * Peer-to-peer courses are courses taught "on-demand" and without a prepared curriculum. A new field of online education has emerged in 2007 through new online education platforms." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_education#Platforms>)

1194.22 Web-based intranet and Internet applications and information are the means of delivering training. If acquisition of telecommunications products (e.g. for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)) or telecommunications services or information kiosks or computer products is also required, these are additional EIT deliverables, each requiring a Government Product Accessibility Template (GPAT).
