On January 18, 2017, the [U.S. Access Board][1] published a [final rule][2] updating accessibility requirements for information and communication technology (ICT) covered by [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act][3] and Section 255 of the Communications Act.

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) is tasked under this law to support establishment and effective operation of successful Section 508 programs across government. 

This program’s mission enables our team to identify and establish best practices in Section 508 program management, create and run training programs to spread awareness and expertise of ICT accessibility, create a baseline standard for repeatable accessibility-related processes and procedures, and provide technical guidance to agencies and individuals related to the implementation and maintenance of Section 508 guidelines.

## About This Site

Section508.gov provides guidance to Federal agency staff who play a role in IT accessibility. The site addresses several key topics, including:

* **Policy & Management** - Provides playbooks, guidance, and policies to help your agency meet its Section 508 responsibilities
* **Acquisition** - Gives guidance on buying and selling information and communication technology (ICT) within the guidelines of the Revised Section 508 Standards
* **Content Creation** - Establishes the standards for creation of accessible digital content
* **Design & Develop** - Lays out standard design principles to create and manage accessible products
* **Testing** - Lists an overview of testing methodologies for ensuring sites, software, and documents are in conformance with Section 508 accessibility guidelines
* **Training, Tools, & Events** - Showcases online courses, videos, and events for learning and honing accessibility awareness and knowledge

GSA is committed to the accessibility of its information and communication technologies for individuals with disabilities by meeting or exceeding the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

## About the Team

The mandate under Section 508 enables our team to undertake a great number of goals both within OGP and to the rest of the federal government:

* By ensuring accessibility is considered throughout the content development lifecycle, we’re able to better promote effective Section 508 program management 
* Our how-tos, self-paced videos, and online training courses enable education and added awareness and retention of 508 guidelines and requirements based on your role within the agency
* We also provide the ICT Accessibility Testing Baseline to create a bank of standardized/accredited testing methodologies and tools that agencies can use to measure conformance of their products to Section 508 standards
* Our array of online tools like the Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART) and Solicitation Review Tool (SRT) provide resources to assist agencies in their own effective implementation of 508 requirements

Our team is on standby to assist with technical support, guidance, and advice to both agencies and individuals with more specific questions and issues relating to implementation of Section 508 requirements.
