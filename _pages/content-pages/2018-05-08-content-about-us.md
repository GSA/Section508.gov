The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is tasked under [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act][3] to provide technical assistance to help federal agencies comply with Section 508 requirements, and ensure that covered ICT is accessible to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities. 

## About the Team

GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) created the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program to focus on providing support to federal agencies in the following primary areas:

* Policy & Program Management 
* Accessible Acquisition 
* Content Creation
* Accessible Design and Development
* Accessibility Testing, and
* Accessibility Training & Events

The team partners with U.S. and foreign government agencies, industry, nonprofits and academia to develop guidance, tools, training and other related materials at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels to help federal employees and the public “Build, Buy, and Be Accessible”.

* By ensuring accessibility is considered throughout the content development lifecycle, we’re able to better promote effective Section 508 program management 
* Our how-tos, self-paced videos, and online training courses enable education and added awareness and retention of 508 guidelines and requirements based on your role within the agency
* We also provide the ICT Accessibility Testing Baseline to create a bank of standardized/accredited testing methodologies and tools that agencies can use to help measure conformance of their products to Section 508 standards
* Our array of online tools like the Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART) and Solicitation Review Tool (SRT) provide resources to assist agencies in their own effective implementation of 508 requirements

Our team is on standby to assist with technical support, guidance, and advice to both agencies and individuals with more specific questions and issues relating to implementation of Section 508 requirements.  If you need assistance in developing or providing accessible products or services to your customers, visit our [Contact Us][4] page.
