                Click events happen when learners release the mouse button, not
                when they press the mouse button down. This helps learners
                recover if they accidentally click the wrong target. They can
                move the mouse away from the target before releasing the button
                if they do not want to activate the target.

                The course uses distinct semantic groups, ARIA landmarks, and
                structured controls that follow a consistent order and
                hierarchy.

                The slide objects are labeled correctly, so learners with screen
                readers know what they are and how to interact with them.  The
                course also uses on-screen text or alternative text to describe
                objects throughout the course.

                Storyline 360 content modules are two-dimensional presentations
                with fixed aspect ratios. They're designed to zoom in and out,
                but they can't reflow without losing meaning and context. As a
                result, learners might see vertical and/or horizontal scroll
                bars at the highest zoom levels. The guideline allows
                two-dimensional content, such as presentations, to scroll in
                both directions.
