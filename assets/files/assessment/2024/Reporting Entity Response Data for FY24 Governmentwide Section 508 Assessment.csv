program at DFC is less than a year old so we are trying to establish an entire program with limited staff.

While we understand DFC procurement does aim to buy only compliant tools, we having trouble getting a clear picture of our inventory, the VPATs, etc. We intend to work on that journey more this year with their partnership and in collaboration with OA.","Section 508 Program at DFC is less than a year old. We took a lot of initiatives to stand up this program, however, we have also not had the time to fully test or remediate the intranet, the internet, or most agency documents.

It would be helpful if OMB/GSA, as they prepare learnings from this year's survey, if they one of the calls of action is (a) increased transparency and (b) calling on OPM to identify points of contacts that agencies can work with to better understand the accessibility of the government-approved tools and (C) for resources and software that is being shared/used government wide, we need easy ways to locate those VPATs and we need folks who are responsible for procuring/renewing/building those things to be advocates for Section 508 compliance and to continue to push for ""better"" on each new release/renewal.

To be actively engaged in the review of applications going through our SELC process and to make 508 determinations of the ICT products going through our Change Request and Technical Reference Model processes. To create online self-paced courses that personnel can access anytime on learning to create accessible digital content. To focus on testing applications as part of the integration with the security authority to operate process. To increase our outreach to the disaster locations and SLTT partners regarding the accessibility requirements of their digital products. To integrate accessibility conformance language into our mandatory courses which has been a long time coming for us!,I think we are obtaining the buy-in from leadership as accessibility is now part of the performance measurement process where we have goals that are directly reported up to leadership regarding our progress with our external websites and internal digital content conformance. We are better integrated within the SELC process and ITAR (acquisition) processes and are working to develop an Action Plan Worksheet on how to better inform personnel of their responsibilities as outlined in our signed 508 Management Directive and instruction. We are interfacing with more programs through use of the 508 Planning Checklist where teams are actually planning for how they will address accessibility conformance throughout the life cycle process. ,"1. Design and development of ICT products - more teams are engaging us as they begin to develop applications rather waiting until it is time to test them.

","The Army Section 508 Team has been able to focus on drafting initial policy, staffing the Section 508 Team, and engaging with stakeholders across the enterprise to solve critical issues. ","A: Policy Development: The Army Section 508 Program has been focused on improving Section 508 policy and setting the foundation for an effective and mature Section 508 Program. The Army Section 508 Program plans to release a Section 508 Policy Memorandum in 4QFY24. The team is also working on additional Policy Memorandums focusing on Testing and Assistive Technology. 

B: Section 508 Awareness: The Army Section 508 Program has been working with stakeholders to improve awareness of Section 508 requirements across the Enterprise. We are working at getting Section 508 Liaisons across the Enterprise (as an additional duty) to help spread Section 508 awareness and solve critical accessibility issues.  

C: Exceptions: The Army Section 508 Program have developed an improved framework for Section 508 exception requests that should be released in 4QFY2024.",Education and awareness across the enterprise. Staffing policy and actively engaging with stakeholders has helped improved awareness of Section 508 requirements and the benefits to ensuring ICT is accessible. ,The Army Section 508 Program is still in its beginning stages and most actions are being conducted on an ad hoc basis until a full time Program Manager is hired.  We look forward to getting this PM on board early in 4QFY2024 to help advance the program and move towards increased compliance throughout the Army.,Department of the Army,ARMY

9)Commitment to Continual Improvement: Review and enhancement of SOPs and policies emphasize the SBAs dedication to continuous improvement in ICT compliance, ensuring sustained adherence to accessibility standards.
10Ensuring compliance: Analyzing Section 508 metrics can help pinpoint specific areas where accessibility enhancements are needed, leading to ongoing improvement efforts.
","1)Resource Allocation / Training and Awareness: Increased resources, conducting more remediation and accessibility testing has shown a positive impact and improved efficiency in addressing accessibility issues.  Promoting a culture of accessibility awareness and conducting training sessions with consistent and comprehensive knowledge transfer on creating accessible documents has increased compliance of ICT products.
2)Policy Development and Best Practices: Creating best practices, processes, and the 508 ICT policy demonstrates a commitment to compliance and accessibility standards. Focusing on this area shows a positively impact ensuring a clear framework for adherence, setting guidelines for compliance, and establishing a structured approach to accessibility across the SBA.
3)Enhanced Testing and Monitoring: Increasing the number of public-facing websites testing, utilizing automated testing tools, helps in identifying accessibility issues, monitoring compliance metrics, and improving overall accessibility. Focusing on this area results in better identification and resolution of accessibility issues, enhanced reporting on compliance metrics, and an improved user experience for individuals with disabilities accessing the SBAs websites.
By prioritizing these areas, the positive impacts include improved accessibility compliance, streamlined processes for handling accessibility requests, a stronger framework for adherence to standards, increased awareness and skill set in compliance, enhanced communication and training for stakeholders, and a more accessible digital environment across the SBA.
","1. Limited Resources: Insufficient resources, such as staffing constraints, has hindered the SBAs ability to address accessibility issues and ensure 100% compliance on ALL ICT. The Section 508 team has experienced a significant influx in the volume of requests requiring remediation, review, and accessibility testing. Since June 2023, the volume of work has surged by 390%, while the current team size falls short of additional resources needed to meet the Service Level Agreement (SLA) stipulated in ServiceNow.  This increase can be attributed to expanding our outreach on Section 508 which has garnered positive feedback, resulting in a surge of 508 service requests.  To better manage this surge in workload effectively, we implemented an automated tracking system on the ServiceNow platform for remediation, review, training, and deferrals. 
The substantial increase in workload has necessitated putting some tasks on hold due to the time-consuming nature of reviewing and remediating documents to ensure 100% accessibility. Our goal is to cater to all requests within the SLA without delays or holds. The necessity for additional full-time resources is evident from our performance metrics, aiming to accommodate the growing demand for our services. 
2. Policy Development and Implementation: Delays in our Policy review and approval process.  Not having an approved 508 ICT Policy can lead to non-compliance with accessibility standards.  The 508 ICT policy is currently undergoing a review and approval process, and we aim to have an approved policy upon its completion.  
Addressing these challenges and implementing improvements in resource allocation, training and awareness, policy approval and implementation can help enhance 508 compliance within the SBA.

SharePoint portal. 
 Leveraged Microsoft 365 forms and developed a process for tracking and supporting requests for training and assistance with document remediations for external and internal electronic communications.  Developed a PowerPoint library of slides from trainings and other presentations conducted by the PMO. 
","the impact of the above changes on Section 508 compliance within DHA is that by Offering on-demand document remediation training, this  enables the PMO to conduct targeted role-based training to various audiences, and provide access to document remediation fundamental training.  
By leveraging Microsoft 365 forms to create a document remediation intake form, the PMO is able to provide expertise on complex document remediation activities for soon-to-be public facing documents. This has improved the coordination with DHA Strategic Communications team and their processes for posting to public-facing websites.  
The slides library enables PMO to build customized trainings for stakeholders via a library of pre-made slides for each MS Office tool and Adobe PDF, as well as Section 508 introduction training customized for audience 
 learning needs. 
"," - In FY23, DHA reported that content posted to external websites was reviewed on an ad hoc basis. In FY24, through collaborative efforts with strategic communications/public affairs and their  organizational processes, content is regularly reviewed (25-59% of the time) wherein the Section 508 PMO provides SME support on complex noncompliant documents. 
- The Section 508 PMO's training frequency has increased from an ad hoc basis, as reported on the FY23 assessment, to regularly (approximately 7 times per year) in FY24's assessment. 
","Challenges include getting stakeholders to understand that S508 is both a technical and legal requirement, and lack thereof puts the agency for legal risk. 
"," 100 percent compliance is impossible for any electronic content or Information Technology. However, This assessment requires entities to indicate true or false for conformance. This approach does not accurately reflect the conformance of ICT products. For example, a website could have WCAG violations which do not impact overall accessibility but still be usable and accessible. Whereas, the reporting requirements would consider such a website to be noncompliant due to minor or single WCAG violation of a success criteria. ",Defense Health Agency,DHA

Keeping Up with Evolving Standards: Staying current with the continuously evolving accessibility standards and best practices has been challenging. Regular updates to guidelines require constant learning and adaptation.

Resource Constraints: Allocating sufficient resources, both in terms of personnel and tools, to effectively manage and maintain compliance has been a very big struggle. This includes balancing other operational priorities with accessibility initiatives.

Ensuring Consistent Compliance: Ensuring consistent compliance across all digital assets, especially with numerous teams and projects, has been difficult. Variability in the level of understanding and commitment to accessibility among different teams has led to inconsistencies.","Future Initiatives: Plans are underway to introduce more robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms to track compliance progress more accurately. This will help in identifying areas for further improvement and ensuring accountability.

Stakeholder Engagement: The entity is actively engaging with stakeholders, including users with disabilities, to gather feedback and insights. This user-centered approach is helping to refine and enhance the accessibility features of digital assets.

Training implemented the monthly Accessibility Tools User Group (ATUG) training started in October 2023 that focused on the following accessibility tools, JAWS, ANDI, and JAWS Inspect. Additionally, we promoted the capability for different departments, and employee resource groups to requested personalized accessibility training from 18 different topic areas using their own personalized content. ","The impact of the most recent changes are, when it comes to the Accessibility Tools User Group, development team members have been provided the capability to track and measure their efforts of “baking in accessibility” proactively and have implemented improved the speed of delivering accessible content. In addition, their use supports the Return on Investment (ROI) of the allotted Section 508 budgeted funds. The promotion of Personalized Group training has encouraged coworkers to see the benefits of working on accessibility together on common content. 
","The topic 3 areas of focused improvements since the last assessment
1.	More official communications are Section 508 compliant and follow the agency's directive of including director's review and approval in the signature
2.	Both federal and contract staff are creating more accessible content in the native files (Word, PowerPoint) prior to converting to PDF, if they do at all. 
3.	The PBGC development community and their federal project managers have increased 1) their proactive collaboration with the Section 508 via the use of Accessibility tools, 2) requests to participate in their integrated project teams throughout their life cycle.","Some challenges we have are 1) implementing of the use of consistent best practices of Word documents, e.g., templates for procurement 2) creating compliant tables without merging cells and using tables for layout when unnecessary, and users making PowerPoint slides compliant with the use of media (e.g., video or music) and adding appropriate alt text or captioning.
"," The Section 508 Team is working to reorganize the library of content currently available to ensure employees can search and find content successfully on their own: without a 508 team member compiling it providing it to them.

1.	Last year's public-facing website scanning score was 76%. This year, it improved to 90%.
2.	In the past 12 months, 11,876 people have been trained in accessibility-related subjects, including the Trusted Tester certification program, document remediation training, and best practices.
3.	The team is developing a new training course for developers and a sample accessible code library, establishing best practices for incorporating accessibility early in the development lifecycle.
4.	A collaborative team across two OCIO offices is creating interim solutions for global cloud platform accessibility issues.
5.	Accessible Electronic Documents Community of Practice (AEDCOP) is working on a document remediation baseline with the U.S. Access Board to align test processes with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards.
6.	New training is being developed to include accessibility in the discovery phase of projects and the customer experience design process.
7.	The team is now fully integrated into Program Health Assessments for major IT programs, with three key questions on contract language, testing, and accessibility training to ensure accessibility considerations are part of project development and management.
8.	Updated the Trusted Tester certification program to align test process with WCAG 2.1 standards.","The integration of the DHS HQ 508 program into the DHS Customer Experience Directorate has led to significant improvements in Section 508 compliance, such as: 
1.	Increased Compliance Scores: Public-facing website scanning scores improved from 76% last year to 90% this year, reflecting enhanced accessibility measures.
2.	Expanded Training: Over the past 12 months, training initiatives have reached 11,876 people, covering a range of accessibility topics. This training supports ongoing compliance efforts and builds a knowledgeable workforce.
3.	New Resources and Best Practices: The development of a training course for developers and a sample accessible code library is establishing best practices for accessibility throughout the development lifecycle. Updated the Trusted Tester certification program to align test process with WCAG 2.1 standards.
4.	Interim Solutions for Cloud Platforms: Collaborative efforts have resulted in interim solutions for global cloud platform accessibility issues, providing immediate support while waiting for permanent fixes.
5.	Document Remediation Baseline: The creation of a document remediation baseline with the U.S. Access Board aligns testing processes with WCAG 2.1 standards, setting a government-wide benchmark for accessible electronic documents.
6.	Incorporation of Accessibility in Project Phases: New training is being developed to integrate accessibility into the discovery phase of projects and the customer experience design process.
7.	Enhanced Program Health Assessments: The integration into Program Health Assessments includes key questions on contract language, testing, and accessibility training, improving accessibility considerations in major IT programs.

Overall, these changes have led to higher Section 508 compliance levels, better accessibility practices, and improved user experiences for DHS programs and services.","•	Technology Insertion Request Process: The Section 508 Program is now fully integrated into the """"Technology Insertion Request"""" (TIR) process, formerly known as “Technical Reference Model” (TRM). We updated 508-related questions and added the attachment capability for submitters to attach supporting documents, such as test reports, voluntary product accessibility templates (VPATs), and compliance determination forms (CDFs) to make the review process seamless.
•	Program Health Assessments (PHAs): We are restoring PHAs for high-impact or high-cost projects across DHS. These assessments help evaluate and improve the accessibility of key projects, ensuring they meet Section 508 standards.
•	Quarterly Section 508 Program Survey: We revised the questions for the quarterly Section 508 program survey to include customer experience aspects, providing more detailed feedback on accessibility challenges and progress in collaboration with the DHS Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO).","•	Operational Change: Aligning the Section 508 Program with the Customer Experience Directorate (CXD) caused initial disruptions. Adapting processes, roles, and responsibilities was challenging but aimed to improve both accessibility and customer experience.
•	Budget Constraints: The continuing resolution and budget limits have restricted resources, such as: delaying the internal website update, limiting our ability to expand our accessibility subject matter experts, hindering our ability to do budgetary exploration into acquiring an internal scanning tool, and lack of full enforcement on accessibility requirements.
•	Authority Shift: The transition from the Office of Accessible Systems & Technology to CXD reduced our authority and affected our ability to get timely responses from Component 508 Program Managers, causing issues with communication and cooperation on accessibility requirements.","Assessing an agency's Section 508 compliance is challenging due to the complexity and nuances involved. The current evaluation methods in the GSA/OMB annual Section 508 assessment does not align practically with how federal agencies collects data, which focuses on testing and reporting. This misalignment can result in misleading responses, despite our high compliance rate. Improvements are needed in the question formats within the annual assessment to enable federal agencies a more accurate understanding of their 508 compliance practices.",Department of Homeland Security,DHS

Training & Lifecycle Integration: Targeted training for development teams and project managers emphasizes incorporating accessibility early in the technology development lifecycle.
Governance Measures: The program has implemented robust governance through:
Clear policies and guidance on accessible content creation (PowerPoints, SharePoint, websites, applications).
Training on accessible meeting practices and data visualization (Tableau, ESRI mapping applications).
LMS accessibility enhancements.
Office hours for personalized support and questions.","Increased Awareness and Accountability:
Section 508 awareness has grown across ARS, reinforced by mandatory sign-off for website and application deployments, integrating 508 sign-off into CCB","Top Areas of Improvement (Section 508 Impact):

All of our Section 508 updates have been in response to their requests.  A lot of our 508 items belong to the Department as a shared service they own.,Our parent Department is supposed to run section 508 reports against our website and other areas.  It is unknown if they have or what those results are as they do not share those with us.,"We have not focused improving any areas as far as I understand, because we do not have the resources, time or training to do so.","Because all of our systems are maintained by our parent Department, we are not given information on any section 508 reports.  If they run them, they do not share the information with us.  If they don't run them, then they are the ones that own the system and are supposed to implement many of the section 508 updates.","Unfortunately, most of EDA's answers are simply ""Unknown"" due to the fact that most of our systems are maintained through a shared service agreement our parent Department manages and that we pay into.  So a lot of the systems 508 accessibility remains in their hands to coordinate and fix as we do not have access to do so.

When the new EDA.gov was put into place almost 2 years ago, it went through extensive 508 testing from the developer and everything was all set and compliant, minus some legacy documents.  Then it was handed over to the Department of Commerce's OCIO team and they have been in charge ever since.  I was told they purchased a SiteImprove license for our website, but since the initial report, I have not received any SiteImprove information.  Those all stay within DOC and we have no control over those systems and software.

Also since we do not have a 508 program office within EDA, there is no coordination when it comes to the different areas/offices and what they do to adhere to section 508.

Lastly, EDA does not require training for 508 accessibility.  Training is on the individual to find, request, and take.  And with no agency set 508 training requirements, most individuals do not realize that it is part of their job to understand section 508.  There has never been a formal training schedule set up for our agency.",Economic Development Administration,EDA

qualified Section 508 Program Manager. Another decision was to assign the assessing EES to the program for coverage until a Program Manager is hired
and placed. Once hired, the covering ESS will work collaboratively with this new Program Manager to get the Agency back on track by identifying and
addressing barriers, reaching the federal standards and guidelines for compliance for the Bonneville Power Administration. Target Date for Placement:

- Information Technology Systems and infrastructure of BPA the ICT platform - External and internal Communications","a. Technological Updates and Compatibility: Keeping up with rapid technological changes and ensuring that new software and platforms
are accessible can be difficult. Legacy systems may not be easily updated to comply with current standards. b. Resource Constraints: Limited budgets
and personnel can make it challenging to implement and maintain compliance measures. Specialized knowledge and tools are often required to assess and
enhance accessibility. c. Training and Awareness: Ensuring that all staff are adequately trained in accessibility best practices is essential but can be
challenging. Continuous education and raising awareness about the importance of accessibility are necessary. d. Testing and Verification: Regular testing
for accessibility compliance can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Automated tools can help but may not catch all issues, necessitating manual
testing by trained personnel. e. Content Creation and Management: Ensuring that all digital content, including documents, videos, and websites, meets
accessibility standards requires ongoing effort and vigilance. f. Vendor and Third-Party Compliance: Ensuring that third-party vendor
and contractors also adhere to Section 508 requirements can be challenging. Clear communication and rigorous contract requirements are necessary. d.
Changing Regulations: Staying updated with evolving legal and regulatory requirements related to accessibility can be difficult. This includes adapting to
changes in standards and guidelines.","To effectively rectify the challenges identified in question #4, the following are actions that BPA will consider once the Section 508 coordinator is hired and placed
to strive towards compliance: a. Comprehensive Audit: Conduct a thorough audit of all digital assets to identify areas of non-compliance with Section 508
standards. This includes websites, documents, software applications, and multimedia content. b. Develop an Action Plan: Create a detailed action plan
outlining the steps needed to address identified issues. This plan should include timelines, responsible parties, and specific goals for achieving compliance.
c. Resource Allocation: Ensure that adequate resources, including budget and personnel, are allocated to implement the action plan. This may involve hiring
accessibility experts or consultants. d. Training Programs: Implement training programs for all employees, particularly those involved in content creation,
IT, and procurement. Ensure they understand accessibility requirements and best practices. e. Regular Monitoring and Testing: Establish regular
monitoring and testing protocols to ensure ongoing
compliance. Use a combination of automated tools and manual testing by accessibility experts. f. Update and Maintain Policies: Review and update
accessibility policies to reflect current standards and best practices. Ensure these policies are communicated clearly to all staff and stakeholders. g.
Engage with Stakeholders: Involve stakeholders, including users with disabilities, in the process of testing and providing feedback on digital assets. Their
input can provide valuable insights into real-world usability. h. Leverage Technology: Utilize available technology and tools designed to enhance
accessibility, such as screen readers, voice recognition software, and other assistive technologies. i. Vendor Management: Ensure that all third-party
vendors and contractors are aware of and comply with Section 508 requirements. ",Bonneville Power Administration,BPA

1.	Comprehensive Accessibility Audit: Conducted a thorough audit of all digital assets, including websites, applications, and documents, to identify areas of non-compliance and prioritize remediation efforts.
2.	Training and Education: Provided extensive training programs for staff, focusing on accessibility best practices and the importance of Section 508 compliance. This included workshops, webinars, and online courses tailored to various roles within the organization.
3.	Accessible Design Guidelines: Developed and distributed detailed design guidelines to ensure that new digital content and technologies are accessible from the outset. These guidelines cover key areas such as keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and alternative text for images.
4.	Remediation of Existing Content: Undertook significant efforts to remediate existing digital content, such as updating old PDFs to be accessible, improving website navigation, and enhancing the usability of online forms.
5.	Partnerships and Collaboration: Engaged with external organizations and accessibility experts to stay informed about best practices and emerging trends in accessibility, and to seek advice on complex compliance challenges.
","The implementation of the aforementioned changes has had a substantial impact on Section 508 compliance within the reporting entity, yielding several key benefits:
1.	Improved Accessibility of Digital Assets: The comprehensive audit and subsequent remediation efforts have resulted in significantly more accessible websites, applications, and documents. This ensures that individuals with disabilities can effectively access and use the entity's digital content.
2.	Enhanced User Experience: By adhering to accessible design guidelines and involving users with disabilities in testing, the overall user experience has improved. This has led to greater satisfaction and usability for all users, not just those with disabilities.
3.	Increased Staff Awareness and Competence: The training and education programs have raised awareness about the importance of accessibility among staff. Employees are now more knowledgeable about accessibility best practices and are better equipped to create and maintain compliant digital content.
4.	Continuous Compliance Monitoring: Regular testing and monitoring have made it possible to identify and address accessibility issues promptly, maintaining a high level of compliance over time. This proactive approach helps prevent the accumulation of accessibility barriers.
5.	Institutionalized Accessibility Practices: The integration of accessibility requirements into internal policies and the designation of accessibility champions have embedded accessibility considerations into the entity's culture and daily operations, ensuring long-term commitment to compliance.

a. Implemented a new process into the acquisition/procurement process for identifying ICT purchases and reviewing and approving exceptions.
b. Completed work on a contract for 3 trusted testers out for Request for Information (RFI). Expected award date is Oct 1, 2024.
c. Implemented a process to incorporate assistive technology users for testing.
d. Increased training for content managers for the DFAS Portal.  
e. Working a Lean6 Black belt project to identify all ICT at DFAS and its 508 compliance status.
f. DFAS has its first certified trusted tester for ASKDFAS.","Impact
a. Prior to the implementation of this updated form, there was no oversight for claiming exceptions.   Now there is an approval process that allows the 508 PM to oversee all exception requests and ensures ICT purchases are identified and 508 language is incorporated into contracts.
b. Obtaining 3 trusted tester/accessibility SMEs will allow us to test our ICT, develop processes, and strengthen our 508 program.
c. Conducting user testing with participants with disabilities is a valuable and inclusive approach to gathering insights for digital experiences. Testing with various assistive technologies also ensures usability with our products.
d.  Content Managers now produce more consistent compliant document formatting across the agency reducing rework.
e. Identifying all ICT in the agency is necessary to prioritize testing and understand the needs of the program. 
t. ASKDFAS is one of our public domain sites and having a trusted tester available to test it is imperative for maintaining 508 compliance.","Areas of Focus 
a. Incorporating 508 into the life cycle
b. Communications
c. Training","Challenges
a. Lack of staff to assist customers and develop artifacts to support implementation of processes
b. Identifying and remediating PDFs issues in a consistent manner

application, processes, responsibilities, and resources for information and training. October 2023 - EHSS established a Section 508 Training and Resources
site on the DOE/EHSS Energy Hub. This internal DOE site includes: 508 requirements, training and resource information and links. Videos of EHSS 508
basic training DOE 508 Coordinator on how to create accessible pdfs and fillable forms hosted by EHSS are posted. Additionally, upcoming 508 training
events are provided in the form of an Outlook invite that allows all DOE users to add these training sessions to their individual calendars. November 2023: Email
training Invitations to EHSS conducted/hosted 508 training sessions were extended beyond EHSS to include the DOE 508 Coordinator distribution (508
coordinators throughout DOE) who are encouraged to share these within their respective DOE offices.","Various DOE Program Offices have acknowledged EHSS as a leader in 508 program implementation based on EHSS 508 training sessions and
centralized training and resources accessible by DOE federal and contractor employees. The DOE Deputy Secretary's office communicated their awareness
of DOE organizations looking to EHSS as a 508 training and informational resource. They indicated that more DOE organizations may be reaching out to
EHSS for assistance. Individuals from various DOE organizations have requested inclusion on distribution of EHSS hosted 508 training announcements. A
DOE Program office who attended EHSS 508 training sessions, including an individual with a visual impairment in that office, acknowledged what EHSS has
done on 508 and requested a briefing on the EHSS 508 Program to identify gaps in their service and develop a plan to improve 508 implementation.
Specifically asked about established processes for ensuring 508 compliant content on our websites; 508 resources needed and their respective roles and
responsibilities. DOE offices acknowledged the EHSS 508 Training and Resource site on the DOE/EHSS Energy Hub as being helpful. EHSS has had a
request for the use of EHSS 508 training videos on the EHSS Energy Hub for independent use in training the organization's staff.","EHSS was not included in the FY23 Assessment, however, we have focused on continual improvements over the past year on:
- 508 awareness communications to include attention to recent DOE Reasonable Accommodation (RA) Program announcements about lunch and learn series to
demonstrate software and hardware assistive technology, as well as built-in Microsoft accessibility features. Attending these sessions would support EHSS
employee understanding about how software and hardware can be used to accommodate disabilities in the workplace.
- Improved support to individuals with impairments using Microsoft Teams for EHSS 508 training. 
- EHSS provides upfront instructions in the Chat for turning on closed captioning and the EHSS/DOE trainer describes the content of the slides being used for the training sessions. 
- Links to the 508 compliant power point presentations and training video is provided to attendees.","Digital Signature is at the top of the list for the most common non-conformance issues. Digital signatures render a document non-complaint. Typically a document is locked after signing. The signature is labelled as a Tagged Content Issue. This is an issue that transcends DOE and other federal agencies.
Other challenges include: the energy.gov template issue that has not been resolved. 
Basic training is not a mandatory training requirement at DOE but should be to support all DOE employee accountability for awareness and attention to the need for implementation and support EHSS expanded 508 training efforts. 
With the exception of the Siteimprove tool provided by DOE for the energy.gov/public website, 508 tools to support compliance/remediation on our websites are at a cost. DOE provides a SiteImprove tool that generates weekly reports on compliance issues on the DOE public website (Energy.gov); however, organizations have many websites where tools (are at a cost) that are needed for 508 assessments and remediation.
Although there are tools within Microsoft that support accessibility checks, these are not as full proof as other tools. For example, automatic alt text does not meet the requirements for an accurate description of images.","EHSS uses DOE provided Siteimprove that scans the EHSS energy.gov website and provides a weekly report that allows EHSS to fix any identified compliance issues. EHSS regularly performs in the 87th percentile for compliance on using this tool. Although EHSS checks all content posting requests to ensure 508 compliance on our Energy.gov and Energy Hub websites, and remediates when needed, there are some innate issues with the Energy.gov template that is controlled by the DOE Office of Public Affairs (PA) that prevents 100% compliance by EHSS. In addition to the Siteimprove tool
implemented by DOE, EHSS uses additional compliance scanning tools (Siteimprove browser plugin, WebAIM WAVE, SortSite Desktop, and Accessible
Web WCAG Color Contrast Checker and plugin). The Sortsite scan of the energy.gov/public website identified the compliance issue due to a design template that again, that can only be resolved by PA. This means that even with one unfixable non-compliant item on a page EHSS pages will be identified as non-compliant.","Office of Environment, Health, Safety and Security",EHSS

We've added manual testing to the existing automated testing process for all new pages and content on our public sites.

We started running monthly automated testing on any intranet pages that have been updated and remediating accessibility issues.  We added an accessibility review of all documents that come through the internal communications office. Over the last year there has also been a focus on making ONRR's social media 508 compliant. Social media text is also checked for readability and reading level.

Emergency management has implemented several changes to increase 508 compliance, including Accessible Emergency Alerts in the Everbridge notification system. We started providing alerts in multiple formats, such as text, audio and email. We added closed captioning to audio and safety video content. Ensuring emergency websites and online resources meet 508 standards.

Some ONRR units found this question too subjective.
","Increased compliance of web pages; increased accessibility of intranet pages; Increased accessibility of documents that are reviewed by internal communications; all social media users can view our content and this will help increase our social media reach; a more inclusive and effective emergency preparedness response to and recovery from an emergency event; individuals with disabilities receive timely and accurate emergency services, and information is provided in accessible formats (e.g., large print, audio description) for their safety.","We do not have a 508 program or dedicated 508 lead at ONRR.

Despite this, the focused areas for improvement have been emergency communication, increased manual testing for webpages, and compliance of all press releases.
","No Section 508 program or dedicate lead ""officer""; communications functions are decentralized making accessibility review inconsistent; lack of developers to implement fixes to known accessibility issues, lack resources for intranet manual testing; ensuring that 508 compliance is baked into work flows; lack of staffing.",No,Office of Natural Resources Revenue,ONRR

They have enhanced the Section508 program for ICT  with strengthened policy, best practices, and training resources. CCR have collaborated with the Accessibility Community of Practice to create agency best practices for Accessibility Conformance Reports format for easier sharing across divisions made available by GSA.  USCCR as also provided recommendations for updating Section 508 guidance to address accessibility concerns.  These efforts aim to promote accessibility and compliance throughout the Civil Rights Community. ","SCCR has learned that it can improve Section 508 compliance by adopting strategies used by the General Services Administration (GSA). Using a central hub for resources, collaborating with an Accessibility Community of Practice, and updating guidance based on feedback and legislation are key steps. By enhancing accessibility and promoting compliance, USCCR can better serve all external  and internal stakeholders.","1. Improved Text to Speech: Many computers and mobile devices today have built-in text-to-speech programs. USCCR improved its third party text to speech for report reading.Some people with disabilities, including the blind, use special programs called screen readers. Screen readers provide important features such as heading browsing, spoken image options, and identifying internal and external links. They can also read the text as it is read aloud so that people can see and hear the content at the same time. Content must be properly encoded in order for all features of the text-to-speech software to work with the content.


2. Adding More Manual Testing for Reports.
    Moving forward with adding ways to manually check documents before publishing. 




","Most USCCR staff have several roles as the agency is a small independent agency.  Wearing too many hats can dilute focus. So USCCR are working with our report writers to include training on Section 508 compliance for the web publishing.

The Office of Information Technology continues to offer support and guidance for helping ensure BIE and its websites are utilizing the U.S. Web Design System and incorporating accessibility testing procedures. ,Educating BIE about the importance of incorporating Section 508 conformance and testing will hopefully raise awareness and encourage the bureau to follow federal standards. There is currently push-back from the bureau in regards to following Section 508 with ICT in exchange for opportunity of meeting immediate requirements for services.  ,Continued implementation of U.S. Web Design System for website development of BIE.edu and BIE-operated school websites. Acknowledgement from BIE of current web standards supporting Section 508 and the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act. ,"Challenges include lack of resources, lack of or inadequate considerations at the early stage of the ICT life cycle management process, lack of or inadequate knowledge by developers, lack of or inadequate knowledge by vendors, and poor quality of vendor's accessibility conformance reports.",BIE often awards ICT contracts in which Section 508 nor federal web standards are not fully satisfied with contractors even if they are indicated as requirements. ,Bureau of Indian Education,BIE

In addition, DIA's legacy systems make integration of necessary changes costly and ineffective.

DIA IT Accessibility PMO plans to make the DIA IT Accessibility Awareness Course an annual mandatory training for all DIA employees. This course explains Section 508, its importance, and how compliance enhances ICT accessibility for employees with disabilities. The PMO collaborates with industry partners to develop and test a speech recognition application for Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) employees. This application will enable DHH employees to participate in meetings and events without sign language interpreters. If successful, DIA will be the first in the Intelligence Community to provide such customized assistive technology. The PMO is also establishing an accessibility testing center to ensure systems and digital products are compatible with assistive technologies, improving usability for DIA users. In December 2022, the DIA IT Accessibility PMO launched the DIA IT Accessibility Advocacy program to distribute Section 508/IT accessibility expertise across the enterprise. IT Accessibility Advocates attend monthly workshops and access resources on creating accessible digital content per Section 508/IT accessibility policies and guidelines. A primary goal of the program is to encourage Advocates to train and certify as DHS Trusted Testers, significantly increasing the number of certified testers at DIA. In October 2023, the PMO drafted policies to support and enhance the DIA Section 508/IT Accessibility program in areas such as accessibility testing and validation, policy development, and training. Challenges persist, particularly with the Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) process, complicating Section 508 procurement and the use of assistive technology. DIA faces additional security considerations compared to non-IC counterparts, making it time-consuming to integrate assistive technology onto Agency Baselines. The lack of standardization and reciprocity in assistive technology leads to inconsistencies.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Defense Intelligence Agency,DIA

Accessibility and Accommodations (OAA), we have led initiatives to enhance our collaboration with the Bureau of Diplomatic Technology (DT), the Department's IT organization. This includes dedicated monthly meetings with the Deputy Chief Information Officer to discuss all accessibility-related topics. DT has ensured that the Section 508 Program Manager (PM) has had the opportunity to present at several high-level, Department-wide meetings such as the E-CISO Council, CIO Monthly Sync, and DT senior staff meetings, emphasizing the importance of a unified accessibility effort. Additionally, the Section 508 PM was invited to present at a breakout session during the Diplomatic Technology Officer Conference in Athens, Greece, addressing lead IT officers at various US Missions worldwide. During this session, the Section 508 PM highlighted the goal of increased worldwide collaboration between OAA and DT, especially overseas, and provided an in-depth overview of the Department's progress in meeting Section 508 compliance standards.  

OAA has been working with our Office of the Procurement Executive to modernize and improve the accessibility of our acquisition programs.  As a result of this collaboration, this fall we will have updates go live for the Department of State Acquisition Manual and the Foreign Affairs Manual (Department policies and procedures) to clarify the role of the Section 508 Program Manager as the sole decision-maker on all exception requests, and the requirement that all solicitations include dedicated Section 508 language.  

In May 2024, the Department awarded a Firm-Fixed Price contract for Section 508 services across the entire Department of State. This includes acquisition review, web testing, training, and consultation. Over the past year, these efforts, along with data collection for the annual Section 508 Assessment, have raised the profile of Section 508 and highlighted to high-level officials the importance of accessible ICT.","The Section 508 program will assess all ICT procurements exceeding $100,000 as part of a new manual review process. This initiative stems from the addition of the Department's first dedicated Section 508 full-time employee, who joined OAA in May 2023. His immediate impact on the program has been instrumental in providing expert guidance to the Department of State's acquisition professionals.  

Following the 2023 Section 508 Assessment, OAA has conducted Section 508-focused presentations for over 300 acquisition professionals at the Department. While many changes are still in the early stages, we have already seen improvement in some of the metrics measured in the annual Section 508 Assessment.  ","The State Department has dedicated almost a year to revamp the acquisition process to ensure 508 plays a key role in procurement. Although this may not be reflected in the 2024 Section 508 Assessment, we have dedicated considerable time and resources to this effort and expect greater improvements in the coming years.  

We have enhanced collaboration with Diplomatic Technology and other IT-focused programs across the Department to integrate Section 508 compliance into processes as early as possible. This proactive approach includes engaging with bureaus responsible for public-facing content and those involved in the selection and implementation of internal tools. ","Collecting fundamental ICT data for the Section 508 Assessment has been challenging.  The Department of State is a global agency employing 25,000 full-time employees and an additional 50,000 locally at U.S. Missions worldwide. In addition, various bureaus control public-facing content, and Section 508 compliance is often not prioritized or is only considered at the very end of the content creation process, making enforcement even more difficult. 

Several top documents/websites were moved or replaced mid-year and could not be evaluated, causing difficulties with respect to conformance metrics. ","The Section 508 Assessment has elevated the topic of accessibility and sparked conversations about supporting employees with disabilities within the Department. The program, historically overlooked, is now receiving significant attention and resources. Demonstrating that the Department is being evaluated and developing “scorecards” has revitalized the program, instilling a greater sense of responsibility towards employees with disabilities and the public.

methodology employed for estimating the percentage of public interest web pages conforming to Section 508 standards involved a multifaceted approach.

i.	Outreach and Training Initiatives: We launched a comprehensive outreach effort to educate the agency-wide community on the importance of accessibility from the beginning of the development process, rather than as a final consideration. This includes the incorporation of Section 508 training into the new employee orientation program, ensuring that all new agency employees understand that accessibility is a fundamental requirement, not an afterthought. 
ii.	Completion of Section 508 Policy Draft: The draft of CISA's Section 508 policy has been completed and is currently awaiting final review and signature. While it is unlikely to be implemented before the end of this fiscal year, we are optimistic about its approval and implementation in FY25, which will provide a formal framework for accessibility practices across the agency. 
iii.	Expansion of Test Report Templates: We have expanded and detailed our test report templates for various types of testing methods, including PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF, and software/websites. These updated templates are designed to improve communication and make it easier for developers to understand and replicate accessibility issues as well as the severity of each defect to assist prioritization efforts. 
iv.	Launch of Internal SharePoint Site: We created and published an internal SharePoint site dedicated to the Section 508 program and the agency's assistive technology program. This site provides accessible information and resources for all employees, supporting our commitment to accessibility and offering a centralized hub for Section 508-related content. ","The changes implemented over the past year have had a positive impact on Section 508 compliance within CISA: 
i.	Increased Awareness and Training: The new outreach efforts and inclusion of Section 508 training in the new employee orientation has significantly raised awareness about accessibility requirements. Employees are now more informed about the importance of integrating accessibility from the outset of projects. 
ii.	Development of a Formal Policy Framework: The completion of the Section 508 policy draft represents a major step toward formalizing accessibility practices. Once approved, this policy will establish a clear framework for compliance and governance, guiding future efforts and ensuring consistent application of Section 508 standards across the agency. 
iii.	Improved Testing and Reporting Practices: The expanded test report templates have enhanced our ability to communicate accessibility issues effectively. This improvement facilitates better collaboration with developers and leads to more effective remediation of accessibility problems.
iv.	Enhanced Resources and Support: The new SharePoint site serves as a valuable resource for accessibility information and assistive technology support, fostering a more inclusive environment and providing employees with easy access to Section 508 resources.","Since the FY23 Assessment, CISA's Section 508 Program has focused on the following key areas for improvement: 
i.	Enhancing Accessibility Training and Awareness: We have focused on expanding our outreach efforts and integrating Section 508 training in the new employee orientation program. This initiative aims to install a strong understanding of accessibility requirements and their importance from the beginning of each employee's tenure. 
ii.	Formalizing Section 508 Policies: We have worked on finalizing the draft of CISA's Section 508 policy, which will establish formal guidelines and procedures for ensuring compliance. This policy is a critical step towards creating a consistent and comprehensive approach to accessibility across the agency. 
iii.	Improving Testing and Reporting Processes: We have refined our test report templates for various types of content and applications, aiming to improve the clarity and effectiveness of our accessibility testing and reporting processes. This effort supports better communication of issues and more effective remediation strategies.",Operational Challenges During Organizational Changes: The migration from DHS HQ's network (LAN-A) to CISA's own network (CISANET) has posed significant challenges. Establishing a new Microsoft O365 tenant required extensive configuration to meet security and accessibility requirements. While there have been efforts to address accessibility needs. We are working to address these hiccups and ensure that accessibility considerations are integrated into all future configurations.,"As CISA continues to grow and evolve, we anticipate a hiring spree to expand our agency's capabilities. We will continue to focus on ongoing evaluation and improvement of our Section 508 practices. This includes assessing the effectiveness of the new policy once implemented, refining our training programs, and enhancing our testing and reporting processes to keep pace with emerging accessibility standards and technologies. We plan to expand our training efforts and develop additional resources for Section 508 compliance. This includes creating more detailed guidelines for accessibility best practices and providing ongoing support to ensure that all employees are equipped to meet accessibility requirements. We are committed to fostering a culture of accessibility within CISA. This involves not only implementing policies and procedures but also engaging with employees at all levels to emphasize that accessibility is an integral part of our mission and not a secondary consideration.",Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,CISA

These actions collectively contrib. to a more inclusive dig. landscape, aligning w/ OCIO's mission & signif. inc. 508 comp","The impact of these changes on 508 comp. w/i OCIO has been substantial. Leadership buy-in for accessib. has been achieved, w/ accessib. now prioritized across all programs w/i the agency. This prioritization has generated significant momentum toward identifying & addressing gaps in policy, process, & procedure.

Mgmt, inc. org. momentum, & improved comp. w/ 508 stds. The cont. efforts to enhance accessib. reflect OCIO's ded. to creating an accessible dig. env. for all users.","Since the FY23 Assessment, the entity's Section 508 Program has focused on improving the following top three areas:
1. Accessibility in Procurement: The program has placed a significant emphasis on integrating accessibility requirements into the procurement process. We are working towards developing the workflows for products and services procurement and developing an acquisition playbook. By ensuring that all new technology acquisitions comply with Section 508 standards from the outset, the entity is working towards proactively preventing future compliance issues. 
2. Comprehensive Training and Enhanced Awareness Campaigns: To raise awareness and enhance the understanding of Section 508 requirements, the program is developing and rolling out customized program centric practical training and awareness programs. These initiatives include regular training sessions, open office hours, developer's workshops, and the dissemination of educational materials. The training programs are designed to equip staff with the knowledge and skills needed to incorporate accessibility into their daily tasks, ensuring that accessibility considerations are embedded throughout the organization's operations.
3. Enhanced Testing and Validation Procedures: The program has significantly improved its testing and validation procedures to ensure compliance with Section 508 standards. This includes the adoption of both automated and manual testing methods to rigorously evaluate digital content and technologies. By implementing these comprehensive testing protocols, the entity can identify and remediate accessibility issues more effectively, ensuring that all digital assets are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
These focused improvements demonstrate the entity's commitment to creating an inclusive digital environment and ensuring sustained compliance with Section 508 standards.","In the past year, BEP has encountered several challenges while creating a framework for incorporating in all areas of operations within the agency in relation to Section 508 compliance. The organizational assessment revealed significant structural and procedural gaps that require attention. Specifically, we identified a need for substantial improvements in policy processes and workflows. Additionally, there is a necessity to identify risks systematically and develop customized training content tailored to specific program working groups, enabling them to effectively implement accessibility practices in their daily work.
Our assessments indicated that many of the core areas are currently at the initial level of the accessibility maturity model. Consequently, comprehensive frameworks need to be developed across all fronts to elevate our accessibility standards and achieve sustained compliance with Section 508. These challenges underscore the importance of a concerted effort to build a robust and inclusive digital environment within the organization.",BEP is making steady progress towards creating an inclusive working environment. We are taking a step-by-step approach to enhance our Section 508 compliance program. One significant initiative is the establishment of an accessibility working group. This group will bring together interested stakeholders to collaborate on improving accessibility practices and ensuring that our digital and operational environments are inclusive for all employees and users.,Bureau of Engraving and Printing,BEP

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aligns underneath the Department of Transportation (DOT), and with the new DOT Section 508 Program Manager, there is a greater line of communication between the Department and the other transportation agencies.  Due to the vast number of Lines of Businesses (LOB) and Staff Offices (SO) within the FAA required to be involved in FY 23's OMB Assessment of Section 508, one of the outcomes was a greater awareness of POCs to collaborate with.

From an acquisition implementation standpoint, awarding a 3-year ordering vehicle with ordering capacity up to $4.9M, significantly increased the Department's capacity to contract with AbilityOne sources.  In this regard, the solution the team implemented not only provides the Department with an enterprise-wide approach to fulfilling Section 508 requirements, but simultaneously contributes to the fulfillment of DOC's AbilityOne pledge of 1.5% of spend per fiscal year; a pledge bureaus have worked hard to meet but which has proven difficult to reach in past years.  
","As indicated, since the last reporting period, DOC worked diligently to finalize and implement the Department-wide Section 508 Checklist. The single checklist ensures standardized data collection and correspondingly a standardized approach to enforcing compliance with Section 508 terms and conditions, increasing both efficiency in Section 508 reviews and quality of outcomes. 

The Department-wide Section 508 blanket-purchase agreement offers a full range of services required to implement Section 508 initiatives, bringing 5 different work streams into a single requirements document that enables the Department to operate in a unified manner in fulfilling Section 508 requirements. 

The Department also developed a checklist to ensure content posted within the Commerce Learning Center is Section 508 complaint before it is deployed for use and has held several IT accessibility related training sessions for Department Employees to attend.

The team includes one Federal employee and three contractor FTEs, following the addition of two new contractors in FY24.
The Section 508 team has partnered closely with the Content Management System (CMS) team to help resolve accessibility issues on public-facing webpages. This collaboration has significantly increased the number of compliant public webpages based on Section 508 standards.
Since the assessment there has been a noticeable increase in cooperation with disability-related affinity groups, including SOAR Employee Resource Group, Human Capital, Energy Justice and Equity, DOE Reasonable Accommodation staff, and DOE employees with disabilities. This engagement has fostered better understanding and integration of accessibility needs.","With the additional resources, the Section 508 team can handle more tasks simultaneously. Our outreach and training initiatives have expanded significantly, all while maintaining the usual high standards for day-to-day remediation and support activities.
Tens of thousands of accessibility issues have been resolved on public-facing webpages, leading to a substantial increase in overall compliance.
Enhanced collaboration, especially through feedback from individuals with disabilities, has enabled the Section 508 team to better prioritize ICT accessibility issues. 
Working closely with other departments within DOE has improved our ability to gather and share information more effectively.

","DOE is a very large agency with over 114,000 thousand federal and contractor personnel. Ensuring that electronic documents conform to Section 508 standards has been challenging.

This cross-functional working group represents a critical first step toward TIGTA's compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Working Group has enjoyed initial success by satisfying most of the relevant OMB deadlines and working toward meeting other deadlines. These accomplishments include: 

-	Report to OMB the name and contact information of the agency's Section 508 Program Manager (“508 PM”).
-	Report changes in Section 508 Program Manager.
-	Establish, review, or update digital accessibility statements on all agency websites.
-	Establish a public feedback mechanism for receiving complaints or reports about accessibility issues with agency websites and digital services.
-	Conduct a comprehensive assessment of agency policies to ensure that EIT accessibility considerations are incorporated in all relevant agency functions. (in progress)
-	Develop a plan to update agency policies to align with the requirements of M-24-08, as needed.","The Working Group's efforts will lay the foundation for a robust and comprehensive Section 508 Program that both ensures TIGTA's compliance with applicable authorities and fosters an agency culture prioritizing accessibility of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT). 
","The top two areas of focus to improve TIGTA's Section 508 Program since the FY23 Assessment are:  
1) Establishing TIGTA's Section 508 policy to satisfy the June 18, 2024, deadline set by the OMB. The final draft of the policy was circulated for 30-day functional review on July 26, and comments are due by August 26. Publishing this policy will satisfy the final major deadline from the OMB memorandum and provide an opportunity for the 508 PM and 508 WG to identify longer range goals.
2) Establishing the Section 508 Working Group. This cross-functional working group represents a critical first step toward TIGTA's compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. While many challenges remain, these changes are a major milestone for the foundation of the Section 508 Program.","TIGTA has faced the following challenges in the past year in regards to Section 508 compliance: 
Lack of staffing resources;

Lack of or inadequate training;
Lack of or inadequate authoring, development, or testing tools;
Lack of or inadequate knowledge by acquisition officials;
Lack of or inadequate knowledge by developers;
Section 508 is not prioritized; and

Using data from this pilot collection, we document basic facts about volumes, rates, counterparty types, collateral,  and  haircuts  in  this  relatively  opaque  segment  of  the  repurchase  (repo)  market.    We  find  that  on  three  dimensions—rates,  counterparty  types,  and  collateral—pilot  participants'  activity  in  the  NCCBR  segment  roughly  mirrors  their  activity  in  the  centrally  cleared  bilateral  segment,  the  DVP  Repo  Service of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC).  However, we find that haircuts in NCCBR materially differ from those in tri-party repo, with over 70% of Treasury repo in NCCBR transacted with zero haircut.  Our findings suggest that differences in haircut, margining, and netting are primary factors that drive dealers' use of NCCBR over other segments of the repo market (Brief no. 23-01).",https://www.financialresearch.gov/briefs/files/OFRBrief_23-01_Why-Is-So-Much-Repo-Not-Centrally-Cleared.pdf,Office of Financial Research Annual Report 2022,"The OFR's 2022 Annual Report to Congress found overall threats to U.S. financial stability were elevated compared to last year.

The CFTC has created a training plan that includes training for all staff, for web content creators, for executives, for system developers, and for procurement staff.

The CFTC has also created a Section 508 page for the CFTC intranet and included instructions for filing a Section 508 complaint. The CFTC has begun testing the web content and addressing the deficiencies found in both the external and internal web sites. The CFTC has also added Section 508 objectives to the DEIA strategic plan, and is creating a roadmap to fulfill these objectives. ","2.	The above changes have met with the approval of the CFTC Persons with Disabilities affinity group, and the effort shown, as well as the training, has increased the awareness of the existence and importance of Section 508. 
","3.	The top areas of focus for the CFTC since the last assessment have been testing web content, providing training for all staff and specialty positions, and creating a web page for the intranet with information on Section 508.

The team has created Section 508 resource and training documentation for document accessibility, web accessibility etc.  CFPB has developed an internal SharePoint Section 508 website that stores all the information and education for Section 508.  CFPB has finalized a draft Section 508 policy that is currently under review.  
CFPB has implemented Section 508 service offerings in the Bureau wide ticketing system e.g., ServiceNow.  CFPB has also begun the tight integration of Section 508 into the enterprise lifecycle process.  CFPB web accessibility expert has begun software testing and feedback reporting for CFPB systems. CFPB now has a Expert Document Accessibility team that trains, evaluates and remediates document for conformance to Section 508.   CFPB has developed a document accessibility feedback form to educate Bureau staff on how to make document accessible.  
The CFPB Accessibility Team is registered for Trusted Tester Certification.   
Manual and automated testing is completed on all design components.   Automated testing on every public webpage code change.  CFPB added a new accessibility checker into the content management system.  CFPB purchased an enterprise web accessibility monitoring tool which includes accessibility training.  In 2024 brought on a new lead to head up the web accessibility efforts at CFPB Digital Services","b) The impact of the changes that were made in the last year was that more Bureau staff are educated on how to comply with Section 508 and that Section 508 program services are now available.

By equipping employees with the necessary skills and fostering a culture of accessibility awareness, we aim to significantly improve the accessibility of our internal and external digital content. We have also made improvements by identifying a POC for Section 508. ","By equipping employees with the skills to identify and remediate accessibility barriers, FAS has significantly increased the accessibility of digital content. This has been achieved through a concerted effort to foster a culture of accessibility awareness, encouraging employees to prioritize accessibility in their work. As a result, FAS has a deeper understanding of Section 508 standards and their application, leading to faster identification and resolution of accessibility issues. This enhanced operational efficiency is crucial for ensuring ongoing compliance with Section 508 regulations, which are essential for FAS.

The impact of the updated accessibility statement has allowed users to more easily find POC's for complaints and accessibility issues.  Utilizing the accessibility help desk email and provided a centralized point of contact for our office ensures that emails are not lost in an individuals email box and provides more awareness to the team.  The impact of updating our management directive will be providing the most updated instructions as recommended on 508.gov. 
","We have focused on increasing the number of DHS Trusted Testers on dev teams withing OIT.  We have increased our outreach across TSA including contributing to office newsletters and providing 508 overviews to various Town Hall meetings.  We are currently evaluating accessibility testing software to add to our automated testing suite, so that developers can test early in the development process.",The biggest challenge that we face is the self publishing ability on internal sharepoint sites and the lack of mandatory 508 training.

new Department of Commerce Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) offered by the National Institute of the Blind and its subcontractors. This BPA provides support for various 508- and accessibility-related activities as part of the Department of Commerce's Strategic Initiative for Diversity, Equity, Inclusivity, and Accessibility (DEIA). The services include testing, training, document remediation, and more, offering valuable resources to NIST staff and enhancing our ability to produce 508-compliant products.

The Commerce Learning Center has introduced new training courses focused on accessibility, including introductory courses for staff and tailored courses for different users, such as designers and web content authors.

The NIST Research Library developed 508-compliant templates for researchers and authors to ensure that NIST technical publications are accessible to everyone. Regular training sessions are also offered to educate writers on the effective use of these templates.

Moreover, ""508 Did You Know"" announcements are published on the NIST intranet every other week. These announcements aim to educate and raise awareness about Section 508 and accessibility, providing quick tips, tricks, and videos on how to enhance the accessibility of the information, communications, and technology created both internally and externally.
","The BPA has allowed NIST staff to use external resources to create accessible products. This is especially helpful for operating units with limited resources to update or fix a large number of older PDF documents that do not meet 508 requirements. 

The introduction of new training courses related to accessibility helps educate NIST staff about 508 requirements, enabling them to create 508-compliant, accessible products. These courses raise awareness about 508 and accessibility, reminding users to consider 508 compliance before creating content. 

Previously, many NIST authors of technical publications were not familiar with 508 requirements. Now, with the help of these templates, they can ensure their papers are 508 compliant with minimal effort on their part. 

We have received positive feedback about the ""508 Did You Know"" announcements, indicating that people are engaged and finding value in them.
","Even though I do not officially hold a full-time Section 508 Program Manager position at NIST, I have been serving in this role on an ad-hoc basis for the past five years. The FY23 GSA 508 Assessment highlighted areas for improvement in our 508 program, enabling me to identify areas where I needed to contribute more to the growth of the NIST 508 program. Over the past year, I pursued additional training courses that significantly increased my knowledge and boosted my confidence in handling internal and external 508-related inquiries effectively.

While 508 compliance training is not yet mandatory for all staff, the Commerce Learning Center (CLC) now offers a wealth of training courses related to 508 compliance and accessibility. This presents an excellent opportunity for staff to learn how to seamlessly incorporate 508 standards in their products.

Through our continued focus on outreach efforts, such as 508 Did You Know announcements, training offerings, and more hands-on work with NIST organizations to make their digital products accessible, we've made great strides in raising awareness about 508 and accessibility. I am optimistic about the positive impact we will continue to make in the future.
","I do not hold the official position of a full-time Section 508 Program Manager at NIST, but I have been fulfilling this role on an ad-hoc basis for the past five years. During this time, I have received extensive training and have addressed all internal and external inquiries and resolved issues in a timely manner. I have also received valuable support from the NIST Section 508 Action Team, a tiger team that was formed to help expand our 508 program and raise awareness of Section 508 and accessibility among NIST staff. Additionally, I have sought assistance from my colleagues at the Department of Commerce (DOC) when necessary. Despite these combined efforts, my part-time commitment to my Section 508 responsibilities makes it inherently difficult for me to engage in all aspects of such a large organization to ensure the accessibility of our ICT products.","I wanted to provide some clarifications to some of my assessment responses:

Question #6: For responses D, F, H, and I, I am dedicated to performing these functions to the best of my abilities, taking into consideration my workload as the NIST Section 508 Program Manager is not my primary role.

Question #8: NIST not only conforms to WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA, but also follows the Department of Commerce Accessibility Policy, which adheres to the WCAG 2.1 at the Level AA standard.

Question #12: All required Siteimprove users were provided with online training conducted by the vendor. I believe that everyone participated in the training sessions offered. In the event that some individuals missed the training, they have access to various training resources through the Siteimprove Academy website.

Question #25: Although I have not been mandated to undergo 508 training, I personally prioritize it and regularly utilize multiple training resources to enhance my skills.

Question #82: At NIST, we offer a variety of information collection apps for creating surveys such as Qualtrics, Box, Google Forms, and Microsoft Forms. Given the large size of our organization and my limited familiarity with the survey activities of our many operating units, I am unable to estimate the number of surveys distributed during the requested time period.

Question #91: While NIST has its own Accessibility statement, we also adhere to the Department of Commerce Accessibility Policy, which encompasses the information in responses A through I.

I hope this information is helpful and addresses any concerns.",National Institute of Standards and Technology,NIST

Continued support of 508 awareness and document accessibility training (508 Awareness, Accessible Meetings; Microsoft Word & PDF) for specific content authors including Federal Sector Hearings Administrative Judges, Office of Civil Rights Division, and various division annual report writers. 

Enhancement of Section 508 Accessibility lab pilot, a contractor supported document remediation service hosted on a secure file transfer site. This semi-self-service gateway available for use-cases specific to improving the accessibility of official agency and widespread communications, better supporting reasonable accommodation requests for accessible files, and ensuring resources to support the compliance of new dashboard and analytics development. 
","
Placement of 508 program management responsibilities into an official FTE position has provided for the increased engagement of senior leaders and bettered the shared understanding of accessibility and our responsibilities to provide equal access to information under Section 508. Attention to task complexity and cost of services has allowed for improved allocation of subject matter expert resources to the highest task type and incremental increases in justified spending to augment document remediation services and captioning.","
With ongoing training and the enhancement of the Section 508 Document Accessibility Lab, generally all electronic content that is public facing conforms to the accessibility requirements. All electronic content that constitutes official business and is communicated by the agency that constitutes an emergency notification, internal or external program or policy announce","Training everyone to make documents accessible is achievable but conformance monitoring is difficult. Training individuals involved in procurement in a risk management process which considers a process for interrogating 508 standards is achievable, but conformance monitoring throughout the acquisition lifecycle is difficult. Vendors still do not understand the section 508 requirements. How might the government encourage the widespread understanding and adoption of accessibility by design?","The reporting agency faces a particularly difficult position when adjudicating claims involving other federal agencies producing Reports of Investigation (ROIs) in formats that seldom provide equal access to information for their claimants relying on assistive technology. ROIs are often large and complex files comprised of disparate document types over a long period of time. They may contain marginalia or other handwriting, or image only information that does not include a text equivalent. Despite great cost of time and funds spent by various federal agencies engaging accessibility of contractors of different skill level and experience, and despite often applying the technical standards of making ROIs accessible, the obtuse PDFs grow in size and volume number to the degree that many blind or keyboard only users may never encounter a complete corpus of the information about their own claim, e.g. an agency may consult the information contained in a single PDF or collection of indexed documents in a document review tool whereas a blind claimant may have multiple (we have seen up to 13 volumes) of PDFs of the same information to be searched individually. All of government should anticipate the need to provide equal access to information in employment disputes and encourage the study of document discovery and production standards which leverage appropriate technology for Report of Investigation.",Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,EEOC

The team also conducted over 100 instructor-led training courses, half on documents and half on technical topics for IT project managers, developers, and testers. The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology. Finally, the Section 508 Program Office also updated the Accessibility Statement and conducted a comprehensive review of organizational policies to ensure Section 508 and digital accessibility is adequately addressed.","Websites are significantly more accessible. Staff who produce electronic content have improved their digital accessibility skills and many are working to ensure digital accessibility is addressed throughout the content creation and publishing processes. Managers and supervisors are more aware of the importance of digital accessibility and are promoting staff training and encouraging process improvement efforts. Technical teams are beginning to incorporate more accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. For example, the Web Team made tremendous strides in overall website accessibility by focusing on ensuring compliance of page templates, procuring a new scanning tool, instituting stricter controls over compliance of submitted content, and ensuring content creators aren't introducing compliance issues. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams have different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Employment and Training Administration,ETA

The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology. Finally, the Section 508 Program Office also updated the Accessibility Statement and conducted a comprehensive review of organizational policies to ensure Section 508 and digital accessibility is adequately addressed.","Websites are significantly more accessible.

The 508 Program Office created and launched three 4-week Section 508 ""Learning Paths,"" which are being run in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of every fiscal year (LP1 = MS Word; LP2 = PPT and Excel; LP3 = Collaborating Accessibly). The team also conducted over 100 instructor-led training courses, half on documents and half on technical topics for IT project managers, developers, and testers. The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology. Finally, the Section 508 Program Office also updated the Accessibility Statement and conducted a comprehensive review of organizational policies to ensure Section 508 and digital accessibility is adequately addressed.","Websites are significantly more accessible. Staff who produce electronic content have improved their digital accessibility skills and many are working to ensure digital accessibility is addressed throughout the content creation and publishing processes. Managers and supervisors are more aware of the importance of digital accessibility and are promoting staff training and encouraging process improvement efforts. Technical teams are beginning to incorporate more accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. For example, the Web Team made tremendous strides in overall website accessibility by focusing on ensuring compliance of page templates, procuring a new scanning tool, instituting stricter controls over compliance of submitted content, and ensuring content creators aren't introducing compliance issues. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams have different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Office of Disability Employment Policy,ODEP

The 508 Program Office created and launched three 4-week Section 508 ""Learning Paths,"" which are being run in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of every fiscal year (LP1 = MS Word; LP2 = PPT and Excel; LP3 = Collaborating Accessibly). The team also conducted over 100 instructor-led training courses, half on documents and half on technical topics for IT project managers, developers, and testers. The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology. Finally, the Section 508 Program Office also updated the Accessibility Statement and conducted a comprehensive review of organizational policies to ensure Section 508 and digital accessibility is adequately addressed.","Websites are significantly more accessible. Staff who produce electronic content have improved their digital accessibility skills and many are working to ensure digital accessibility is addressed throughout the content creation and publishing processes. Managers and supervisors are more aware of the importance of digital accessibility and are promoting staff training and encouraging process improvement efforts. Technical teams are beginning to incorporate more accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. For example, the Web Team made tremendous strides in overall website accessibility by focusing on ensuring compliance of page templates, procuring a new scanning tool, instituting stricter controls over compliance of submitted content, and ensuring content creators aren't introducing compliance issues. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams have different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,OWCP

Technical teams are beginning to incorporate more accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. For example, the Web Team made tremendous strides in overall website accessibility by focusing on ensuring compliance of page templates, procuring a new scanning tool, instituting stricter controls over compliance of submitted content, and ensuring content creators aren't introducing compliance issues. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams have different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Mine Safety and Health Administration,MSHA

The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology.

overall focus from the Web Team has greatly reduced the number of noncompliance issues on public-facing websites. The 508 Program Office created and launched three 4-week Section 508 ""Learning Paths,"" which are being run in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of every fiscal year (LP1 = MS Word; LP2 = PPT and Excel; LP3 = Collaborating Accessibly). The team also conducted over 100 instructor-led training courses, half on documents and half on technical topics for IT project managers, developers, and testers. The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology. Finally, the Section 508 Program Office also updated the Accessibility Statement and conducted a comprehensive review of organizational policies to ensure Section 508 and digital accessibility is adequately addressed.","Websites are significantly more accessible. Staff who produce electronic content have improved their digital accessibility skills and many are working to ensure digital accessibility is addressed throughout the content creation and publishing processes. Managers and supervisors are more aware of the importance of digital accessibility and are promoting staff training and encouraging process improvement efforts. Technical teams are beginning to incorporate more accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. For example, the Web Team made tremendous strides in overall website accessibility by focusing on ensuring compliance of page templates, procuring a new scanning tool, instituting stricter controls over compliance of submitted content, and ensuring content creators aren't introducing compliance issues. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams have different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,OFCCP

overall focus from the Web Team has greatly reduced the number of noncompliance issues on public-facing websites. The 508 Program Office created and launched three 4-week Section 508 ""Learning Paths,"" which are being run in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of every fiscal year (LP1 = MS Word; LP2 = PPT and Excel; LP3 = Collaborating Accessibly). The team also conducted over 100 instructor-led training courses, half on documents and half on technical topics for IT project managers, developers, and testers. The Learning Management System (LMS) team migrated all required online trainings to a fully compliant template, while the Program Office established review procedures to ensure all other online training is accessible. The 508 Program Office also developed and launched a 508 review process as an extra 3rd party audit of new websites and applications; developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT). The organization also procured and launched the Level Access AMP tool to improve automated scanning of websites and web content and is completing the consolidation of JAWS and JAWS inspect to leverage departmental spending and ensure these tools are available for testers and not just for user of assistive technology. Finally, the Section 508 Program Office also updated the Accessibility Statement and conducted a comprehensive review of organizational policies to ensure Section 508 and digital accessibility is adequately addressed.","Websites are significantly more accessible. Staff who produce electronic content have improved their digital accessibility skills and many are working to ensure digital accessibility is addressed throughout the content creation and publishing processes. Managers and supervisors are more aware of the importance of digital accessibility and are promoting staff training and encouraging process improvement efforts. Technical teams are beginning to incorporate more accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. For example, the Web Team made tremendous strides in overall website accessibility by focusing on ensuring compliance of page templates, procuring a new scanning tool, instituting stricter controls over compliance of submitted content, and ensuring content creators aren't introducing compliance issues. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams have different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Wage and Hour Division,WHD

Specifically, we have updated our policies and procedures, and established a Program Plan. The latter also allowed us to create and Advisory Council and formalize our annual reporting cycle.","Challenges we faced have mostly been confined to the growing pains of standing up a new program. Information gathering has been improving, however additional funding for agencies to respond to the increased reporting requirements would always be helpful.","Nothing additional to share, however we would like to provide some feedback on the questions regarding full compliance on internet and intranet. Specifically, questions 71 and 76. Both questions require a combination of automatic and manual testing in order to provide an answer, but allow for sampling. They both state that only the subsets that were tested with both automatic and manual testing should be reported on. 

In the example of our intranet, the combination testing yielded a very high >90% compliance. However, a full automatic-only scan yielded a 43% full compliance rate. Therefore we reported the lower, but more accurate, automatic-only number. If we had followed the guidance, we would have significantly overreported. A potential solution would be to modify this guidance so that agencies can use automatic-only to fully scan their sites, with a subset of sampling by both methods, and report the combined number.",Federal Trade Commission,FTC

LMS has been updated to include a Section 508 training course. DSCA has also developed and begun execution of a comprehensive IT Modernization roadmap that incorporates 508 Compliance as a key priority. 

2) An increase in the awareness of the need for compliance, and path toward achieving full 508 compliance.

3) Primary enterprise focus is the modernization of legacy IT systems, incorporating 508 compliance. Primary development focus is on determining a testing process and research to obtain proper testing tools. 

4) Assessment of multiple disparate system for compliance. This challenge has been addressed through the creation and initial execution of an IT Modernization roadmap that incorporates, among other priorities, 508 compliance. 

5) DSCA maintains a number of legacy IT Systems that are currently being modernized, or are scheduled to be modernized. Many of these systems are migrating to Platform as a Service (Paas) and/or Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. In evaluating solutions, various areas of compliance (including 508) were considered, and compliance was a driving factor in selecting a solution. As DSCA's IT Systems are modernized, we will conduct 508 assessment and/or testing as part of the development/migration efforts associated with those solutions. The testing methodology and associated tools remain TBD, but will be part of the modernization effort.

Yes,d) Unknown,"Changes over Previous Year:
- An enterprise ticket process was implemented for employees to report ICT accessibility concerns and have them tracked to closure (February 2024)
- An email address was set up for receiving IT accessibility requests from the public, as part of the agency's Website accessibility statement (December 2023)
- The agency's Web site accessibility statement was updated to comply with M-24-08 and added to public and internal websites (February 2024).
","Impacts of Changes:
-             We have received less than 10 public inquiries and employee requests through email and ticketing system, which were addressed. We are continuing to track the incoming requests and refine our outreach and workflows for addressing accessibility for public and workforce. 
","Focus Areas for Previous Year:
- Increased workforce outreach, lunch-and-learns, and other presentations conducted on various IT accessibility-related topics, including an annual NDEAM OCIO IT Accessibility speaker series.
- Secured and committed resources to establish evaluation processes and workflows for Accessibility Conformance Reporting (ACRs) as part of 
the Commercial IT Requests (CITR) procurement process.
- Establishing 508 planning, documentation, and review process to ensure NASA's IT projects are 508 compliant
- Identifying and obtaining additional tools for Enterprise Section 508 evaluation and reporting.
- Secured and committed resources to establish automated and manual testing or validation capabilities at the agency-level
","What challenges has the reporting entity faced in the past year with regards to Section 508 compliance?
- Lack of a standard or centralized collection method for contracts to provide conformance metrics of IT contracts presents complexity to comprehensively gather for analysis and reporting. 
- NASA has a very large web footprint and a historically decentralized governance model; responsibility for policy compliance is delegated to site owners who are responsible for assessing website conformance.
- NASA does not track web pages, only websites.
- There is no comprehensive inventory or process for tracking and reporting compliance of internal websites.
- Enterprise and manual testing is not routinely used or enforced.
","NASA recently reorganized our enterprise IT services. Prior to this, management and oversight of the Section 508 program was delegated to the local level. As part of the reorganization, the function was centralized within OCIO with an Agency IT Accessibility Lead role established to oversee the program full time. The program is in the process of being reformulated and updated, by December 2024.

NASA tracks websites at the site level, not the page level. If a page on a website is nonconformant, the site is considered nonconformant. In FY23 Q4, NASA released a new public website https://www.nasa.gov/ that will dramatically improve the experience of people with disabilities and be more compliant. Section 508 compliance was a content management system selection factor, and an independent accessibility vendor was hired to test and report issues for resolution to strive for full conformance at every step of the development lifecycle.

NASA does not track intranet sites to the same level as public sites; hosting is distributed and responsibility is delegated to the local level. While we can estimate the number of sites, we are not able to establish the number of pages with any degree of accuracy as many of them are access-controlled.

In our contracting and software development lifecycle, we don't manage the risk of nonconformance; we address cost, schedule, and technical risk. We require that ICT be compliant with Section 508 in order to purchase it or to pass a key decision review. Rather than a risk, it's considered a project constraint. In the case of vendor provided tools and services, we rely on VPAT and ACR results for verification, we don't conduct independent testing.

NASA has a large contractor workforce. We expect that it is our vendors' responsibility to provide staff with the expertise to perform the function we contracted them to do; therefore NASA does not typically provide training to contractors on Section 508.

While support is shown at the top of the CIOO organization, the program still shows gaps. In order to address these gaps, a Section 508 Improvement Plan was developed and approved by the CIOO. The improvement plan enhances areas already thrives (ie training and document compliance) and provides guidance to areas that still need improvement (ie- governance, testing, and procurement). Continued support and funding will remain the greatest importance in order to continue enhancing and progressing a gold star program. ",The largest impact on the changes is managements understanding of the need for resources. An additional FTE will be added to the program during FY24 and a part time contractor was added for Power BI dashboarding. ,"The top area of focused improvement is the general awareness of the need for strong contractor or fed support for document compliance. Not only is the FDIC Section 508 team growing, but other divisions and offices not recognize that 508 is not a part time (or quarter time) position, but a full FTE or contractor is necessary. General Awareness is also increasing within training as a REQUIRED ""Section 508 Awareness Training"" was approved for development in FY24 and will be developed and in production by FY25. ","FDIC's biggest challenge continues to be governance. While management is understanding of the importance of Section 508, the requirement is still not a requirement for governance. Additional challenges lean towards the greater agency's understanding of the requirement (neither right nor wrong, but 508 is within CIOO, therefore most of the knowledge is within CIOO). ","FDIC's program growth and all other agency program growth does not happen without 
1) Funding
2) Leadership support (Top down)
3) Passion for the subject
4) A strong team

Revised the NRC's Digital Accessibility Statements (Statements) on its websites to, among other things, state that the NRC seeks to apply the most recent Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version (currently 2.2), where possible. Also, began to track public feedback when it is received through the feedback mechanisms in the Statements. In addition, revised the statement of work/performance work statement template language for Section 508 requirements to require conformance to WCAG through 2.2 Level AA, when possible.

Introduced use of the Accessibility Insights for Web tool to support manual web testing by developers and integrated Google Lighthouse into the DevSecOps continuous integration/continuous development pipeline as a standard tool for automated Section 508 conformance testing.

Finalized the statement of work for a new web content management contract for the NRC public website, including improved and very strong support for accessibility and web user experience.

Performed a comprehensive assessment of NRC policies and developed a plan to update them.

Enhanced an internal Section 508 guidance website to add resources on more topics, such as alternate and descriptive test for images, maps, mathematical equations and formulas, guidance for using additional accessibility testing tools, etc.

Completed the final draft of a Section 508 Policy Statement, that was later signed by the NRC Chair and published on the NRC intranet in June 2024. It communicates that “all NRC employees play an important contributing role, whether authoring accessible documents or seeking to acquire accessible products and services.”","Due to the changes to the acquisition checklist the NRC is now more prepared to ensure compliance of acquisitions.

Use of the Accessibility Insights for Web tool has increased awareness of accessibility issues and has provided recommended evaluation steps that any developer can follow. It has been particularly helpful for developers who have not yet been trained in the Trusted Tester for Web accessibility testing methodology.

The accessibility testing integrated into the DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline has identified accessibility concerns earlier in the development process and increased developer awareness of Section 508 conformance requirements.

The other changes above are either preparation for future impact or their impact on Section 508 compliance is not yet known.","In general, the Section 508 Program has focused on reviewing the results of the FY23 Assessment and recent Office of Management and Budget memoranda to identify areas where action is needed. Specifically, focus for compliance improvement has been on 1) developing and enhancing guidance, testing tools, and training for ensuring the accessibility of electronic content; 2) developing and enhancing guidance, testing tools, and training for ensuring the accessibility of web solutions; and 3) ongoing support for reviews of draft statements of work for new solicitations for information and communication technology services.","For eight months the Section 508 program had to dedicate most of its time and resources to 1) perform the FY23 Government-wide Section Assessment, 2) review the Assessment results to identify areas where action is needed, 3) address the mandated actions from the Office of Management and Budget's memorandum M-24-08, and 4) to start work on the FY24 Government-wide Section 508 Assessment. This slowed and/or delayed other planned work to improve compliance. One significant delay that occurred was in the development of solicitations to obtain Section 508 compliance support services, postponed until fiscal year 2025.

The Section 508 program continued to lack needed growth in resources to better advance agency compliance. One contributing factor to this lack of growth is the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act cap on the level of the Corporate Support budget for the NRC.","The Section 508 program has worked to obtain funding for additional staff resources (FTE) in fiscal year 2026 and is pursuing additional options, such as rotational assignments.

After the Section 508 policy statement was issued by the NRC Chair in June 2024, there is now more visible executive sponsorship for the Section 508 program. This will greatly help increase employee awareness and stakeholder engagement.

Comments for specific assessment questions:

General Information. Q8: The agency's Digital Accessibility Statement states that the NRC seeks to apply the most current WCAG version (currently 2.2), where possible. Also, the statement of work/performance work statement template language for Section 508 requirements requires conformance to WCAG through 2.2 Level AA, when possible.

General Information, Q22: Section 508 Program guidance recommends obtaining approval from the Office of the General Counsel, but it is not currently required in policy.

General Information, Q24: Adjusted response this year based on stakeholder input.
Policies, Procedures, and Practices, Q35: M-24-08 and completion of a comprehensive assessment of agency policies has expanded what is considered relevant policies.

Technology Lifecycle Activities, Q50: Adjusted response this year based on stakeholder input.

Acquisition and Procurement, Q62: Section 508 is included in the technical evaluation of proposals related to ICT services and products when applicable.

Conformance Metrics, Q73a, 76: The number of web pages evaluated is unknown. Through a contract change, the NRC temporarily lost resources to centrally evaluate and test intranet pages.

NARA organized an Accessibility Working Group to facilitate discussions among organizational stakeholders, including representatives from the Web Program, Chief of Staff's Office (intranet and internal collaboration), Acquisitions, ICT program managers, the General Counsel's Office, and the EEO Office.

2. In response to M-24-08, the Section 508 Program Manager created a comprehensive management plan to improve the Section 508 Program. (see 103.e)

3. The Section 508 Program Manager has worked with ICT Program Managers to increase understanding of Section 508 requirements and artifacts required from contractors, such as the ACR and SAR.

4. The Section 508 Program Manager informed upper management of the importance of funding a strong Section 508 Program and creating a mature program.

5. The Section 508 Program Manager did initial market research in accessibility platforms and content creation and remediation tools.
","1. The Accessibility Working Group has helped to create a culture of awareness about accessibility. 

2. The management plan has enabled NARA to systematically plan improvements in Section 508 throughout the enterprise.

3. NARA has been more successful in ICT compliance during the acquisition process and in having the contractor improve compliance based on issues found in the ACR.

4. Outyear funding requests have been proposed for additional Section 508 staff to alleviate identified resource constraints.

5. NARA has more knowledge of available platforms and tools to plan possible acquisitions.
","1. Improved Section 508 awareness and understanding in the acquisition process, including requesting changes from vendors based on the ACR.

2. Creating a plan to improve Section 508 compliance generally and improving awareness of Section 508 in the enterprise.
","Our main challenges are:

1. The lack of available resources for added staff, testing, training, and remediation. 

2. Contractors not having adequate knowledge of Section 508 requirements, testing, and the creation of the ACR.

3. The necessity of multi-year efforts both to acquire automated tools and then to remediate the backlog of non-accessible legacy content.
","NARA continues working towards creating a fully mature Section 508 program. Our program is strongest in acquisition activities: Section 508 requirements, reviewing VPATs and ACRs, and working with vendors to request changes and improvements in compliance. Our level of compliance for public and internal web pages is also strong. 

The comprehensive management plan will allow NARA to plan and implement additional improvements to the Section 508 Program over the next year and following years. 

The Section 508 Management Plan stresses:

Creating and improving policy.

Creating a cultural awareness of accessibility at NARA.

Performing Section 508 testing under the DHS Trusted Tester model.

Increasing training, including specialized training for content creators.

Creating templates and guidelines for document and content creation.

Working with the Acquisitions Office to improve template language for contracts and the PWS.

Working with the General Counsel's Office and the EEO Office to include users with disabilities in a way that preserves the privacy of the users.

Pursuing acquisitions of an accessibility platform and/or a suite of digital tools.

Creating a prioritized plan to address the backlog of content that needs remediation.

Separately, the bureau needs to implement policy requiring a standard process that all web/digital content must go through (specifically an internal routing process) before any content can go live on public or internal sites. The process must involve the 508 team (after a proper team is built up and testing/evaluating resources provided) and should place accountability on the supervisors who instruct their staff to create web content. No content should be live until it's fully been reviewed. In addition, the bureau must enforce 508 course requirements for all web content creators on a yearly basis in order to create content for the web. This process for 508 review and testing prior to publishing must be enforced by the bureau leadership and baked into every process, along with accountability and consequences for not following policy, without exceptions.

Section 508 ""Learning Paths,"" which are being run in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of every fiscal year (LP1 = MS Word; LP2 = PPT and Excel; LP3 = Collaborating Accessibly). The team also conducted over 100 instructor-led training courses, half on documents and half on technical topics for IT project managers, developers, and testers. Many BLS staff, including developers, are attending these training offerings, both on their own and due to encouragement from managers and supervisors. BLS has also instituted a 3-week Accessibility Training program for new IT developers (Feds and Contractors) and offers additional standardized accessibility training for technical teams. The 508 Program Office developed and launched role-based intranet pages containing a curated list of training, guidance, and resources for 30+ roles (IT and non-IT).","Websites, applications, and IT systems are significantly more accessible. Staff who produce electronic content have improved their digital accessibility skills and many are working to ensure digital accessibility is addressed throughout the content creation and publishing processes. Managers and supervisors are more aware of the importance of digital accessibility and are promoting staff training and encouraging process improvement efforts. Technical teams have been training on incorporating accessibility best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, including more thorough reviews during the procurement process, better accountability for vendors, user stories/journeys that consider the needs of people with disabilities, and more thorough hybrid testing. All technical teams are working to ensure they have the appropriate staff trained on 508 testing and use of both testing tools and assistive technology to better ensure digital accessibility.","First, there are ongoing process improvement efforts to continue integrating best practices throughout the tech lifecycle, so we have ramped up our technical training schedule and are focusing much more on providing guidance earlier in the process in order to avoid costly remediation. Another large problem we worked to control is that thousands of documents and presentations are created every week by non-IT staff throughout the organization, and many of these have accessibility issues. The Section 508 Program Office's largest initiative has been the creation of the Learning Paths, which are 4-week instructor-led programs that consist of four 1-hour training sessions followed by a 30-minute Q&A. Through the first two cohorts, which includes the pilot, we've had a few hundred people complete the training and the feedback has been fantastic. For example, people who complete the MS Word Learning Path are able to produce fully compliant Word documents that require no remediation. These programs have the potential to save the organization countless hours every year.","The first big challenge is the ongoing implementation of a standardized approach to Section 508 across the technical teams. Different teams had different process and varying levels of accessibility knowledge and skill, so the organization has taken a two-pronged approach: First, conduct ongoing core competency training for technical teams to help create a reasonable baseline; and second, work individually with teams based upon where they are along the continuum from baseline to excellence. Another large ""challenge"" faced by the Section 508 Program Office was having to shift priorities due to OMB M-24-08. In order to conduct the comprehensive review of organizational policies, the team needed to set aside work on the Section 508 Risk Management Framework. Now that the Assessment is over, they will get working on that again. From an organizational perspective, there is excellent support from leadership, and we continue to experience ongoing grassroots support from all staff. ","The Section 508 Program Office is working very hard to standardize the approach to digital accessibility across the Department of Labor and all of its component agencies. As such, they are doing the hard work of training thousands of staff and helping them focus on process improvement efforts that build accessibility in from the start instead of relying on costly remediation. The Program Office has taken the position that accessibility is everyone's responsibility, but they are in the intermediate stages of their change management plan. As such, they are not yet focusing their efforts heavily on enforcement – they're focused on implementing the best practices that can be taught and then enforced. Because there are still many people throughout the organization who need to be trained on digital accessibility, the Section 508 Program Manager and 508 Team Lead will be conducting a ""virtual roadshow"" throughout the end of the 4th quarter and beginning of Q1 FY25. The intent is to give a presentation on the training, resources, and support that the 508 Program Office offers and to present at over 60 all-staff and large team meetings, potentially reaching thousands of people. They will also be heavily encouraging people to attend the next Learning Path cohort, which will begin in January of '25.",Bureau of Labor Statistics,BLS

These changes, while welcome, have resulted in some differences in reporting that are unrelated to our Section 508 Program. Notably, we no longer count FTEs for three groups delegated tasks by the Section 508 Program: 1) publications; 2) fillable forms; and 3) AT support. Last year, we included three FTEs to represent these areas, but we are no longer included in our reported. However, this does not indicate any program or resource changes. Additionally, we aligned our budget number with GSA and OMB guidance, resulting in a lower figure than last year, but it does not reflect a decline in SSA's dedicated resources.
During the reporting period, our Section 508 Program focused on three areas of improvement: 1) communications, 2) expanding test checklists in our testing process, and 3) delivering 1,600 accessible kiosks to 1,250 field office locations. To enhance communications, we established collaborative relationships with affinity and advisory groups, our Civil Rights and accommodations operations, and the assistive technology help desk. We also introduced new channels to better communicate with employees with disabilities and implemented tools to track our communications. Additionally, we added two new test checklists for kiosks and Storyline (an interactive training authoring tool). Furthermore, we deployed 1,600 accessible kiosks to improve the waiting room experience. These kiosks underwent rigorous UX testing, involving users who are blind, have low vision, use wheelchairs, have cognitive disabilities, and are caregivers of people with disabilities.","As a result of improving communications, our employees that need assistive technology support receive timely notifications about system updates, outages, known issues, and opportunities. All communications are now tracked, and we have removed a legal impediment that allows us to reach our intended audience.  
The two new accessibility test checklists we released into our testing operation are improving the rate at which issues are fixed.  The kiosk checklist is published on ssa.gov, and our Storyline test checklist is complete and will be published soon.
Tracking accessibility test results presents many technical and logical challenges. We have a robust test tracking tool we developed in house, and we are impressed with the data we are generating. We have found signals in the data that are helping us better target our resources. For instance, we now maintain a list of the most prevalent defects to target our developer training content.

In our SSA field offices across the country, visitors who are blind, who have low vision, who use a wheelchair, or who may have a cognitive disability are able to use our accessible kiosks to independently complete the check-in process.","Of the items listed in 103a, the kiosk deployment and improved data reporting were our top priorities.","Our biggest challenge is coping with the many platforms that support accessibility, that are available to our code inspection test methods, but the fix for each platform is different.  We maintain fixing instructions on more than seven web platforms and each can be very different from the other.  So, as accessibility platform support improves, our testers and developers experience complications.  Working with platforms is also challenging since 508 defects must be analyzed before the fix is assigned.  Defects can be caused by problems in the underlying platform, and those must be resolved through the Contractor.  In addition, and the application team can fail to implement the platform correctly, and these defects must be assigned to and corrected by SSA staff.  While accessibility support in these platforms reduces the cost of accessibility, it seems to be offset by the complicated nature of how platforms proprietarily support accessibility.","SSA uses a centralized services model with IT handling all of the Section 508 ICT remediation and testing, educating and communicating with product and services teams on their role in creating accessible solutions. In policies, processes, and in practice, Section 508 tasks and activities happen through every phase of the lifecycle.  Project teams regularly seek 508 experts for support with design, development advice, and troubleshooting. The SSA Section 508 Program is robust and mature, and seen as a lead contributor of testing protocols, user research with people that have a disability, and testing tools like ANDI. SSA's 508 Program is well sponsored, and deeply integrated into the IT operation.  We recently added a second Section 508 Program Manager, and we also added a Communications Specialist this reporting period. The Section 508 Program procurement process is mature and consistently results in rapid approvals and needed contract language.  In addition, Section 508 Program staff provide post-award 508 testing services and contract management assistance to all Agency IT purchasers.",Social Security Administration,SSA

We have made introductory Section 508 Compliance training mandatory during employee onboarding.  We also awarded a contract to Deque University to provide in-depth technical training for specific technical roles of both Federal and contractor staff in the CIO organization responsible for the management, design, testing, and implementation of ICT.  The FERC Section 508 Compliance policy has been updated, the FERC Statement of Accessibility has been updated, and an evaluation of agency policies for compliance with ICT requirements has been conducted in line with OMB Memo M-24-08.  We also continue to conduct periodic testing of legacy applications to identify non-compliant features and remediation requirements to add to team backlogs.  FERC continues to leverage the Section 508 SME to provide coaching and remediation support to development teams as well as requests for assistance across the agency.  We continue to look at ways to further the Section 508 Compliance Program, awareness, understanding, and activities for FERC.","By implementing changes and new features to the Section 508 Compliance Program, we have been able to provide more compliant applications and increase awareness and understanding of how to acquire and produce compliant ICT.  The Section 508 Compliance Program is gaining traction with development teams and integrating Section 508 testing early in the technology lifecycle and across FERC as we engage with the Disability Programs.","The top 3 areas where FERC has focused improvement since the FY23 Assessment are training and awareness, policy, and application testing. FERC offers optional, virtual and on demand Section 508 training as well as how to guides for common Microsoft applications, templates, and test scripts to aid in the creation of accessible content.  We have reviewed and updated policies, and we have conducted more frequent application testing and remediation activities. ","The challenges FERC has faced in the past year with regards to Section 508 compliance include the need for additional resources as Section 508 requirements have increased due to more awareness across the agency as well as additional guidance from OMB with OMB Memo M-24-08.  Many of the FERC applications are not public facing and therefore the agency assesses a lower risk for Section 508 compliance.  For example, security vulnerabilities (e.g. DDOS attacks) and aging IT infrastructure/applications present a higher risk and remediation of these are prioritized to maintain Commission operations.  With additional resources, the Section 508 Program will be able to provide more support and address other areas of need identified by this annual assessment such as manual versus automated testing. Additionally, while majority of FERC solicitations are awarded from contract vehicles that include overarching Section 508 requirements e.g. GSA and NASA GWACs, the FERC Acquisition and Procurement team is working to identify and define the appropriate guidance and process to ensure Section 508 conformance is reviewed and assessed as a regular part of the acquisition lifecycle.  ","We are continuing to invest in modernizing our internal and public facing applications and to expand our training for Federal and contractor staff.  The FERC Section 508 Compliance Program continues to mature, and we anticipate more Section 508 compliance guidance and requirements to be provided to contractors and to implement processes to address non-compliant products or deliverables. FERC aspires to be a model employer of persons with disabilities and to provide employees, members of the public, and its constituents with disabilities with equally effective access to our programs and services.
