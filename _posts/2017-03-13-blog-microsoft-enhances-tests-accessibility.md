March 17, 2017 - Section 508’s Coordinators are often asked about ways to test technology for accessibility. Over the last year, Microsoft has worked to make this easier for its customers. In particular, they have focused on making trustworthy technology for all employees and customers while also equipping them with information that will help them understand and validate product accessibility.

By testing Microsoft products for conformance to accessibility standards, Microsoft is able to support customers in the government and private sectors alike. Working extensively with the Department of Homeland Security’s Trusted Tester Program, Microsoft has been able to simplify these tests through a systematic engineering process.

In a Microsoft blog post dated December 17, 2015, entitled [Microsoft leaders affirm commitment to accessibility][1], Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, reaffirmed that accessibility is core to the company’s mission. At the Microsoft Ignite 2016, Satya Nadella’s speech embodied the plan to make artificial intelligence (AI) accessible to everyone.

Microsoft has stated that their vision is to create great products that are accessible to everyone - at home, in the workplace and in classrooms.

For more information regarding Microsoft’s role in testing for accessibility, see their recent blog post [Supporting enterprise and government customers with accessibility standards conformance testing for Microsoft products][2].
