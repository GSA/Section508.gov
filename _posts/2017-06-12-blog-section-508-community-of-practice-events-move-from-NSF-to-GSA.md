On Thursday, August 10, 2017, the Section 508 Community of Practice (CoP) held its final meeting at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Arlington, VA. After six years, the NSF is moving to a new location, so future CoP events will be held at the General Services Administration at 1800 F Street NW in Washington, DC.

We’d like to recognize **Katherine Otts** for her hard work and dedication to the Section 508 Community over the past six years. She’s been an integral part of facilitating community and planning meetings. In addition, we send a special thank you to **Natalie B. Smith** for her phenomenal support of the Section 508 Community for the past 18 years.

The interactive August 10 meeting on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 featured presentations by Bruce Bailey from the Access Board, and Katie Haritos-Shea, WCAG and 508 Subject matter expert. Both presenters spoke in detail about how the WCAG 2.0 standards impact how an organization procures, develops, and tests Information and Communication Technology (ICT) with regard to the Revised Section 508 Standards. They also shared resources to help organizations get started on their transition to the new Standards.
