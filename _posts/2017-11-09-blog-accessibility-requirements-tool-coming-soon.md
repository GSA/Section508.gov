November 9, 2017 - If you’re a fan of the Buy Accessible Wizard (BAW), but wish it were easier to use, you’ll be happy to know that GSA is hard at work on a new tool which will replace the BAW. This new tool incorporates the Revised 508 Standards, so when you use it, you can be sure you’re conformant with current policy.

The Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART) is a step-by-step guide that will help you easily identify and document accessibility requirements for government procurements and contracts. GSA is going through the security review process to grant the system an Authority to Operate (ATO), which must be completed before the tool can go live and be accessed from Section508.gov.

Until ART is released (we’re expecting to launch it early in 2018), please visit the Revised 508 Standards Toolkit for tools and checklists to help you:

  * Create government accessibility requirements statements that align with the Revised 508 Standards
  * Learn how to request accessibility information from vendors
  * Create contract terms and conditions

Please email us at <section.508@gsa.gov> if you have any questions.
