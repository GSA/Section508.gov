The General Services Administration (GSA) released the FY24 Governmentwide Section 508 Assessment on December 19, 2024, continuing an effort mandated by Congress &mdash; through the requirements in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/text" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Public Law No. 117-328</a> codified at <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2022-title29/html/USCODE-2022-title29-chap16-subchapV-sec794d-1.htm" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">29 U.S.C. ยง 794d-1</a> &mdash; to evaluate the accessibility of federal agencies' digital content and compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. This annual report provides valuable insights regarding the ongoing efforts and accessibility-related improvements across federal agencies. The report also provides details on the accessibility of government websites, software, hardware and electronic content. This report helps Congress and agencies address gaps in information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility and work toward creating more accessible digital ICT for both public users and federal employees with disabilities.

This year's assessment found that while the respondents are improving their overall efforts to manage accessibility programs, the accessibility of ICT used by the public and federal employees still has substantial room for improvement. On average, about one-third or less of the top-viewed websites, documents, and videos are fully conformant. This gap highlights the need for a stronger focus on accessibility throughout the technology lifecycle, from planning and procurement to implementation and testing.

The report also revealed that limited resources and staffing created significant barriers for many respondents. Though agencies made some resource improvements, such as increasing full-time equivalents to support the Section 508 program, increasing the number of full-time Section 508 program managers and increasing hours dedicated to accessibility work, these gains have generally not translated into bridging accessibility gaps. However, improvements have been made in several areas including organizational accessibility training. Respondents continue to report difficulty in testing and remediating their most-viewed digital content, and many report lacking the tools and staff needed to test and remediate digital content for conformance to Section 508 standards. 

The FY24 assessment includes numerous recommendations to Congress and agencies, such as:

* Agencies should make accessibility a core part of how they design, develop, procure, and manage their ICT.

* Congress should consider strengthening enforcement mechanisms, such as audits and clear accountability measures, to improve compliance and close the accessibility gaps that persist across the government.

* Congress should update Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. ยง 794d and 29 U.S.C. ยง 794d-1 - Electronic and Information Technology) to define agencies required to comply with the statute and adhere to Section 508 standards.
