<h2 style="line-height:1.2;">Need to create a Microsoft Word document but not sure how to make certain it meets Section 508 standards?</h2>

Before sharing or publishing your document, presentation, or spreadsheet, run the built-in Accessibility Checker to make sure your Microsoft Office content does not have easily identifiable accessibility issues. Run the Word Accessibility Checker in three-steps:

1.  On the Word ribbon, select the *Review* tab.Â 

2.  Select Check *Accessibility*.

3. In the *Accessibility* panel that opens on the side, review the results. You'll see a list of errors, warnings, and tips with how-to-fix recommendations for each.

Other authoring tools may include built-in accessibility checkers or similar plug-ins including tools to create or test PDF documents. In fact, these automated checkers may also be available to creators of websites, content management platforms, and software and mobile application development. However, it's important to know these automated checkers are limited in what they can accurately evaluate and may present false positives or fail to report issues. Therefore, to ensure your document, website or software application is fully accessible, **manual testing must be performed** as well.

Authoring guides, checklists and short video tutorials are available at [Create Accessible Documents]({{site.baseurl}}/create/documents/) to help you ensure your documents are accessible.

Creating a presentation, spreadsheet or PDF? You can learn how to create other accessible products by visiting [Create Accessible Digital Products]({{site.baseurl}}/create/) on this website.

Still have questions? Reach out to your agency's [Section 508 Program Manager]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/program-manager-listing/) or contact us at <Section.508@gsa.gov>.
