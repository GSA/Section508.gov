      Quotes from participants
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The workshop exceeded my expectations. Robert and Norm have an excellent knowledge of 508 implementation and they were able to share that information with the audience. Through this type of event our 508 program gains years worth of progress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearing from practices at other agencies was invaluable. Also closing out by creating an action plan with our agency colleagues was a perfect way to keep momentum going. Invaluable strategic information.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think one of the major advantages of this workshop is all of us working together. There's so much enjoyment in helping someone else solve problems that one of us has already gone through. It is a real community of practice&rdquo;
