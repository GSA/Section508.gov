The GSA is proud to announce a new Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR), [OpenACR](https://github.com/gsa/openacr). A simple, modern way to report and evaluate accessibility conformance. OpenACR makes it easier for everyone to build, maintain, validate, and compare accessibility reports - for procurement and beyond.

OpenACR is the result of a one year project to build an open standard document format, create a [simple web editor](https://gsa.github.io/openacr-editor/), and describe the resulting changes for the procurement community.

Leveraging the YAML machine-readable language, the team created a highly structured report format. This can be easily exported to an accessible and readable HTML document.

The GSA engaged [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) to build this prototype based on their leadership with accessibility and open source. The development process took place on GitHub to help generate community input.

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) around the world have contributed to the development of this new tool. If your organization presently uses VPATs, we would appreciate your feedback in the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/GSA/openacr/issues).

This in the pilot phase, but the editor can be used to produce accessible ACRs in an HTML version that follows the VPAT format.
