The GSA is proud to announce the launch of [OpenACR](https://github.com/gsa/openacr), the first open source, machine-readable ACR. 
OpenACR is the result of a one year project to build an open document standard for OpenACR, create an editor to support the creation of the machine-readable documents, and document the process for the GSA.
