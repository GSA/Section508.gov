June 12, 2017 - As a reminder, the biannual OMB Agency 508 Reports are due on August 30, 2017&nbsp;to&nbsp;<feedback@cio.gov>

There is no change in the reporting requirements from the February 2017 submission. Both the reporting template and the associated instructions sheet are attached to this message. If you are unable to access the template because of the version of software your agency is using, you can use an older version of the template and just the data elements identified in the current instructions document.

Any questions about the [template][1] or [reporting requirements][2] can be sent to <feedback@cio.gov>. Any questions about your agency’s specific response, should be directed to your leadership team.
