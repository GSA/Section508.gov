Quick Response, or QR, codes have become integral to digital experiences, bridging the gap between physical and online information. Originally developed for the automotive industry, these two-dimensional barcodes are now used in countless applications---accessing websites, sharing contact information, providing additional product details, and facilitating payments. As their use continues to grow, it is essential to ensure that QR codes are accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities. In the United States, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal electronic and information technology to be accessible to people with disabilities. 

This article explores best practices for QR code implementation to ensure accessibility and compliance with Section 508 standards.

## Wait, Are QR Codes Considered ICT?

Yes, QR codes can be considered **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** under Section 508 when used as electronic content. For typical uses, think of them as an image that needs an equivalent alternative text description, and a link that needs a keyboard equivalent to allow users who cannot scan or interact with the QR code.

Since QR codes often serve as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds by linking users to web pages, multimedia, or other electronic resources, we must address challenges faced by individuals with visual, cognitive, and mobility impairments.

## Barriers to QR Code Accessibility

QR codes pose unique accessibility challenges, particularly for users with:

1.  **Visual Impairments**: Users who are blind or have low vision may not be able to locate, scan, or interact with QR codes.

2.  **Mobility Impairments**: People with motor disabilities may struggle to position or hold a device steady while aligning it to scan the QR code.

3.  **Cognitive Disabilities**: Some users may have difficulty understanding QR code usage or interpreting the subsequent actions.

In addition to disability-related challenges, there are potential barriers to consider, including societal acceptance and norms including privacy and security concerns, and individuals who may be unfamiliar with, cautious about, resistant to, or lack access to technology such as the smartphones or internet access needed to access the information.

## Print vs Digital Display

QR codes offer convenience but can pose challenges depending on the medium in which they are used. In print, issues arise when the code is too small, printed with poor resolution, or placed in areas with low visibility or lighting, making it difficult for users to scan. Additionally, print materials cannot accommodate updates, so if the linked content changes, the QR code and description may become obsolete. Finally, **Section 508 standards do not apply to print mediums**.

In digital mediums, challenges include distance and size, screen glare, poor contrast, or compatibility issues with certain devices or apps, which can hinder scanning.

## Best Practices for Accessible QR Code Implementation

Given the challenges of QR codes, agencies should consider the following practices when planning for **when** and **how** to use them to improve the user's experience.

1. **Use Proper Descriptive Text and Alt Text**

   Alt text and descriptive labels are crucial for accessibility tools like screen readers. Add alt text to any QR code images in digital documents or web content, describing the purpose of the code rather than its appearance. For example:

    -   **Alt Text**: "QR code linking to the product accessibility page."

    -   Descriptive labels should clearly explain what scanning the QR code will do to set expectations.

2. **Provide an Accessible Alternative**

   While QR codes offer a convenient link to information, users with disabilities may need alternative ways to access the same content. To comply with Section 508, provide a text alternative or link adjacent to the QR code. This ensures that users who cannot scan the QR code have another way to access the content. For example:

    -   Include a hyperlink or URL in digital formats such as electronic documents or videos.

    -   Label the QR code with a clear description, such as "Scan this code with your phone's camera to visit Section508.gov."

    -   Include a URL in print media formats.

3. **Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast**

   High contrast is essential for accessibility. QR codes should have a strong contrast between the background and the code itself to ensure legibility for users with low vision or color blindness, and improve scanning success. Use dark colors for the QR code on a light background (or vice versa); recommend adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, which recommend a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and images.

4. **Use QR Codes with User Control in Mind**

   QR codes that automatically perform actions, like sending a text or initiating a download, can be intrusive. To prevent accidental actions, design QR codes to link to a webpage with a clear call-to-action, allowing users to choose when and if they want to engage further.

5. **Test QR Code Functionality with Assistive Technology**

   Test your QR code implementation across multiple devices and assistive technologies, including screen readers and magnification software. Regularly testing ensures that your QR code content and alternatives are accessible to everyone and function as expected. Tools such as VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android can help identify potential accessibility issues.

6. **Establish Guides and Educate Users About QR Code Accessibility**

   Agencies should establish a style guide for using QR codes in digital and print mediums to provide clear, user-friendly instructions to ensure QR codes are accessible to everyone.
