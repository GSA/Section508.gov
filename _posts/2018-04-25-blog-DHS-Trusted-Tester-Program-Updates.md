In April 2018, the Department of Homeland Security announced some updates coming to the [Trusted Tester Program][1], to align with recent updates to the [Revised 508 Standards][2].

The Federal Accessibility Community of Practice has updated the Harmonized Baseline for Testing Conformance, which is used to develop streamlined test processes for IT accessibility. The Trusted Tester Process, training, and Trusted Tester Certification are also being updated to align with the updated Baseline, and are slated for release in Fall 2018. Once updated, the Trusted Tester process will align with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)][3] Level A and Level AA.

IMPORTANT -- Existing V3 certified Trusted Testers must recertify for Trusted Tester V5.
