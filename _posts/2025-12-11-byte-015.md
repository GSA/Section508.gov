<h2 style="line-height:1.2;">Did you know that writing accessibility-focused user stories can help you build high-quality, Section 508-conformant products from the very start—without costly retrofits later?</h2>

User stories are a staple of agile development, but when they specifically address accessibility needs, they guide designers, developers, and testers toward creating ICT that works for everyone.

## How to Write an Accessibility-Centered User Story
User stories define the "what" and "how" to address Section 508 conformance during design, development, and testing, and when writing backlog items.

Use this format:

<div class="code-box">
<span class="code-box-text">As a [user type or user need],<br>
I want [an goal, action or function],<br>
so that [benefit or achievement].</span>
</div>

### Example 1: Keyboard User 

***User Story***: As a keyboard user, I want to be able to access and activate all interactive content such as form fields, buttons, and links so that I can successfully complete forms.

***Acceptance Criteria***: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints [WCAG SC 2.1.1]; There are no keyboard traps on the page [WCAG SC 2.1.2].

### Example 2 : Color Vision Deficiency

***User Story***: As a user who relies on high contrast, I want to view text with sufficient contrast against backgrounds so I can read content easily.

***Acceptance Criteria***: All text meets contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (text that is 14-point bold or larger, or 18 point or larger) [WCAG SC 1.4.3].

## Why This Works

* Integrates with workflow -- Keeps accessibility in scope during design, coding, and testing.
* Clear and testable -- Specifies the "what," "who," and "why," making accessibility measurable.
* Prevents rework -- Reduces last-minute fixes by including accessibility early.

## Quick Steps to Get Started
1.  Identify a user need -- For example, "user who relies on a screen reader."
2.  Define the goal -- What must they be able to do?
3.  State the benefit -- Why does it matter?
4.  Add acceptance criteria -- Link to WCAG or Section 508 standards.
5.  Include it in your backlog -- Make it part of your agile process.

  <strong>TIP:</strong> Embed accessibility conformance into your team’s “definition of done” so it’s always part of the finished product.
