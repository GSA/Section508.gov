-   <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Up to 1 in 4 (27%) adults in the United States</a> have some type of disability, many of which are hidden or not recognizable.

-   The Section 508 Standards federal employees must follow help ensure equal access to ICT including: computers, telecommunication equipment, copiers, printers, software, websites, electronic documents and more for people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities.
