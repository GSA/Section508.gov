<h2 style="line-height:1.2;">Did you know that the order in which elements are added to a presentation can affect how they’re read by a screen reader? Proper reading order is essential for accessibility.</h2>

Screen readers follow the reading order of objects on a slide (sometimes known as the z order), not the visual layout from top to bottom, left to right. Even if a slide appears visually correct, assistive technology may read the content out of sequence. Adding, removing, or rearranging content placeholders&mdash;including in standardized templates&mdash;can change the reading order, which may make the slide harder for screen reader users to follow and understand.

Depending on your version of Microsoft PowerPoint, there are two ways to define the order in which a screen reader announces slide content.

## Selection Pane (Windows and MacOS)
* **Purpose:** Helps you arrange, select, hide, or rename objects on a slide
* **Display Order:** Lists objects bottom-to-top in the "stacking" or z order, opposite of how they are layered in the reading order&mdash;the bottommost object in the Selection Pane appears first in the reading order.
* **Access: Home tab <span role="img" aria-label="Arrow pointing left">&rarr;</span> Arrange <span role="img" aria-label="Arrow pointing left">&rarr;</span> Selection Pane**
* **Use Case:** Organize the visual layout, rename items to make editing easier, and **visually hide an object or layer**&mdash;while making the information available to screen reader users&mdash;during slide design

<div class="tablet:grid-col" style="margin: auto; max-width: 90%; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px">
   <div class="margin-top-1"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/byte-13-figure-1.jpg" alt="PowerPoint presentation slide showing a title page layout with CLICK TO ADD TITLE appearing above CLICK TO ADD SUBTITLE visually, while in the Selection Pane  object TITLE 1 appears below SUBTITLE 2." aria-describedby="figure-1" class="border-2px border-base-light shadow-2 padding-1">
   </div>
   <div class="font-mono-3xs margin-x-auto auto" style="max-width: 90%; text-align: center;"><span id="figure-1"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> PowerPoint's Reading Order pane showing object Title 1 appearing after Subtitle 2.</span>
   </div>
</div>

When adding objects to a slide, use the *Selection Pane* to align and stack them in the correct order.

To open the *Selection Pane*, go to the **Home tab**, then select **Arrange** and choose **Selection Pane**.

The *Selection Pane* will appear in the right-hand sidebar, and displays every object on the selected slide. When you select an object in the pane, it will also be highlighted on the slide&mdash;helping you identify its content and position.

To re-order an item, simply click and drag it within the *Selection Pane*. You can also use the up and down arrow buttons at the top of the list of objects to adjust an object's position.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Make complex slides easier to sort by renaming objects. Simply select an object and press <strong>Enter</strong> or double-click with your mouse, then rename as desired.
</div>

If you use these commands, double-check the *Selection Pane* to confirm the objects appear in the correct stacking order.

To the right of each item is an eye icon, which acts as a button to toggle the object's visual display on the slide (Figure 1). Hidden objects remain in the *Reading Order Pane* and will still be read by a screen reader. This technique can be used to provide a slide title for screen reader users&mdash;helping with navigation and comprehension&mdash;while keeping it visually hidden.

To check the reading order for accessibility:
* Open the **Selection Pane**
* Start from the **bottom** of the object list and move **upward**
* Select each object and consider its order on the slide
* Ask yourself: Does the order in the pane match the intended **reading sequence** for screen reader users? If not, the document may not meet accessibility requirements.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> The reading order shown in the Selection Pane runs <strong>bottom-to-top</strong>. This reflects how objects are layered&mdash;<strong>a screen reader will read the objects in the Selection Pane from the bottom of the list to the top</strong>.
</div>

## Reading Order Pane (Windows Only)
* **Purpose:** Helps set the **order in which screen readers and other assistive technologies** will read slide content.
* **Display Order:** Lists objects **top-to-bottom** order&mdash;opposite from the Selection Pane, meaning a screen reader will first read the object listed at the top of the list.
* **Access: Review tab <span role="img" aria-label="Arrow pointing left">&rarr;</span> Check Accessibility <span role="img" aria-label="Arrow pointing left">&rarr;</span> Reading Order Pane**
* **Use Case:** Organize the visual layout, rename items to make editing easier, and **mark visual layers as decorative**&mdash;programmatically hiding the visual object from screen reader users&mdash;during slide design.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> PowerPoint for the Web does not include the Reading Order Pane. Users should instead use the **Selection Pane** to arrange the reading order of objects.
</div>

<div class="tablet:grid-col" style="margin: auto; max-width: 90%; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0px">
   <div class="margin-top-1"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/byte-13-figure-2.jpg" alt="PowerPoint presentation slide showing a title page layout with CLICK TO ADD TITLE appearing above CLICK TO ADD SUBTITLE visually, while in the Reading Order Pane object TITLE 1 appears above SUBTITLE 2." aria-describedby="figure-2" class="border-2px border-base-light shadow-2 padding-1">
   </div>
   <div class="font-mono-3xs margin-x-auto auto" style="max-width: 90%; text-align: center;"><span id="figure-2"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> PowerPoint's Reading Order pane showing object Title 1 appearing before Subtitle 2.</span>
   </div>
</div>

When adding objects to a slide, you can use the Reading Order Pane to align and stack them in the correct reading order.

To open the Reading Order Pane, go to the **Review tab**, then select **Check Accessibility** and choose **Reading Order Pane**.

The *Reading Order Pane* will appear in the right-hand sidebar by default. It displays every object on the slide. When you select an object in the pane, it will also highlight on the slide&mdash;helping you identify its content and position.

To re-order an item, simply click and drag it within the *Reading Order Pane*. You can also use the up and down arrow buttons at the top of the Reading Order list to adjust an object's position.

If you use these commands, double-check the *Reading Order Pane* to confirm the objects appear in the correct stacking order.

To the left of each object is a checkbox, which acts as a button to toggle the object's description to screen readers (Figure 2). Unchecked or hidden objects remain in the Selection Pane and visually displayed, but will be skipped by a screen reader as a decorative image. This technique can be used to hide a decorative image for screen reader users&mdash;helping with navigation and comprehension&mdash;while keeping it visually displayed.

To check the reading order for accessibility:
* Open the **Reading Order Pane**
* Start from the **top** of the list and move **downward**
* Select each object and consider its order on the slide
* Ask yourself: Does the order in the pane **match** the intended **reading sequence** for screen reader users? If not, the document may not meet accessibility requirements.

<div class="grid-col-12 border-base radius-lg padding-1" style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: #f5f9fc;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> The visual order shown in the <em>Reading Order</em> runs <strong>top-to-bottom</strong>. This reflects how objects are layered&mdash;<strong>a screen reader will read the objects in the Reading Order Pane from the top of the list to the bottom</strong>.

## Key Takeaways
* Assistive technology may read the content in presentation files **out of sequence** when authors add, remove, or rearrange content placeholders.
* Use the **Selection Pane** to control what the audience sees and how it's layered in a logical, accessible order for screen reader users.
* Use the **Reading Order Pane** to control what screen reader users hear and ensure that content is read in a logical, accessible order.
* Rename the **objects** inside the **Selection Pane** for complex slides to aid with reordering.
