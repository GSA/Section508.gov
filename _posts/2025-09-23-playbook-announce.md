We're excited to launch the newly updated **Technology Accessibility Playbook**, a practical guide to help federal agencies build and sustain effective Section 508 Programs that ensure their technology is accessible to everyone---including people with disabilities.

### Why It Matters
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">According to the CDC</a>, Roughly 61 million Americans live with a disability. Yet too many government websites, applications, and digital tools remain inaccessible to members of the public and federal employees alike. The Section 508 law requires that federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, and use information and communication technology (ICT) that's accessible. Meeting this obligation isn't just about compliance---it's about usability and good government.

Accessible technology improves usability for all, reduces legal risk, and supports broader information assurance goals like privacy and security. This Playbook helps agencies take a strategic, scalable, and measurable approach to accessibility.

### What's New in the 2025 Edition?

The updated **Technology Accessibility Playbook** streamlines the guidance agencies need to meet Section 508 requirements with a focus on leadership, integration, and accountability. Key updates include:

  <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
      <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-blue"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#schedule"></use></svg></div>

  </li>
</ul>

Twelve "plays" walk agencies through the steps needed to establish and manage an effective program---from leadership commitment to workforce training.

Plays 1--4 focus on foundational actions: establishing a Section 508 Program Manager, assessing program maturity, setting measurable goals, and embedding accessibility in policy and performance planning.

Plays 5--8 provide strategies to embed accessibility in governance, budgeting, acquisitions, and system design---ensuring 508 compliance is not an afterthought, but a core function.

  <li class="usa-icon-list__item">
      <div class="usa-icon-list__icon text-red"><svg class="usa-icon" aria-hidden="true" role="img"><use xlink:href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sprite.svg#insights"></use></svg></div>
      <div class="usa-icon-list__content"><h4>Better Integration Across Agency Operations</h4></div>
  </li>
</ul>
<!-- #### ðŸ“ˆ Support for Continuous Improvement -->

Plays 9--12 focus on aligning development and testing practices with accessibility requirements, managing issues, and growing an accessibility-capable workforce.
