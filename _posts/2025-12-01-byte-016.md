<h2 style="line-height:1.2;">Did you know that you can use semi-fictional characters that portray an individual or group of users to improve the design, development and accessibility of your agency’s electronic information or digital service?</h2>

These semi-fictional characters, called *[personas]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/glossary/#personas)*, are primarily used in the research and design phase of a project to ensure that the user experience—including equivalent access to information for people with disabilities—is considered for a service, product, or website.

## Design Considerations
Using multiple, diverse personas helps uncover the different needs and expectations---called design considerations---of various user types by illustrating how individuals interact with content and assistive technologies. 

Personas should also reflect attributes that align with [functional performance criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#302-functional-performance-criteria), based on how people use products and services to interact with technology. These criteria include:

-   Without Vision
-   Limited Vision
-   Without Perception of Color
-   Without Hearing
-   Limited Hearing
-   Without Speech
-   Limited Manipulation
-   Limited Reach and Strength
-   Limited Language, Cognitive, and Learning Abilities

## Development Considerations
Business analysts and other requirements officials should use persona-based design considerations to develop acceptance criteria for [ICT accessibility-centered user stories](http://www.section508.gov/blog/accessibility-bytes/13/), ensuring new products or features conform to accessibility standards---minimizing the need for costly remediation.

  <strong>TIP:</strong> Before creating your new personas, check with your agency Web Content Manager or <a href="https://www.section508.gov/tools/program-manager-listing/">Section 508 Program Manager</a> to see if personas already exist for your users and mission.
