title: 'GSA Issues Report to Congress Highlighting Need for Improvement in Federal Government Section 508 Compliance'

description: In accordance with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 the General Services Administration (GSA) has released a landmark report on the current state of federal Section 508 compliance. Findings revealed Section 508 compliance continues to fall short of expectations. The majority of respondents were at or below the average threshold for Section 508 compliance. This trend suggests the federal government collectively is not meeting the Section 508 statutory requirements to ensure equal ICT access for all members of the public and federal employees with disabilities.

The General Services Administration (GSA) just released a landmark report on the current state of federal Section 508 compliance. The report, the FY23 Governmentwide Section 508 Assessment, evaluates reporting entities' adherence to the criteria established by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in coordination with GSA, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and the U.S. Access Board (USAB)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fr1">1</a></sup>. The report provides a comprehensive baseline and recommendations for strengthening compliance initiatives and enhancing Section 508 activities across the federal government.

Under the [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023](https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF), Congress directed GSA, OMB, and USAB to work together to collect and evaluate federal agency data on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility. This effort was focused on enhancing transparency and accountability regarding Section 508 compliance, and was an essential step towards addressing the ongoing need to improve accessibility of federal ICT.

[Findings](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/2023/findings/summary/) revealed Section 508 compliance continues to fall short of expectations. The majority of respondents were at or below the average threshold for Section 508 compliance. This trend suggests the federal government collectively is not meeting the Section 508 statutory requirements to ensure equal ICT access for all members of the public and federal employees with disabilities.

These valuable insights into federal Section 508 compliance contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the situation:

-   Compliance Can Be Improved Across Government: When combined, the 5-point scales for maturity and conformance  produce 25 different overall performance  categories where reporting entities could fall. The assessment team found 76% of reporting entities fell within the bottom 9 categories  with the other 24% falling in the top 16 categories. This signifies performance that is well below the statutory requirement of Section 508.

-   Majority of Top-Viewed ICT Tested Does Not Fully Conform to Section 508 Standards: On average less than 30% of the self-reported top 10 viewed intranet and internet pages, top 10 viewed electronic documents, and top five viewed videos, fully conform to Section 508 standards. 

-   Technology Lifecycle and Policies Activities Still Need Improvement: Despite reporting entities on average faring the best in Technology Lifecycle Activities and Policies, Procedures and Practices, the average maturity  of these responses was only moderate (just over 2.5 on the 5-point scale). While respondents' report higher maturity in these areas compared to the low compliance of ICT governmentwide (average of 1.79 on the 5-point scale), established policies, procedures and practices lack requirements and accountability sufficient to build, buy, maintain, and use Section 508-conformant ICT. 

-   Section 508 Program Maturity Drives Conformance: The more mature a reporting entity was, the better the conformance  tended to be on average. That is, more mature, well-established Section 508 Programs tended to report better conformance to Section 508 requirements for ICT.

-   Resources Are Important:  The more Full-Time Employees (FTEs) the reporting entity had, the more mature a reporting entity was, which led to better conformance. Or conversely, more mature, developed reporting entity programs tended to have more FTEs to support Section 508 conformance activities.

-   Section 508 Program Manager Time Is Well Utilized: We found the more time the Section 508 Program Manager was involved in the program, the better or  more mature that program tended to be, irrespective of program size.

-   Section 508 Program Resources Are Low Across Government: 93 reporting entities reported less than one Section 508 FTE (contractor or federal employee), with 36 of those reporting entities reporting no Section 508 FTEs. Simply put, Section 508 Programs that don't have sufficient staff can't perform adequate Section 508 work.

-   Reporting Entity Size Doesn't Matter: No relationship was found between the size of a reporting entity and the conformance  of that reporting entity.

-   Testing Is Prevalent, But Immature: A significant number of reporting entities (194 or 78%) reported using one or more manual or hybrid ICT accessibility test methodologies for web content; however, governmentwide compliance of ICT was low. Thus, although they have test methodologies and processes, reporting entities may not employ them well or to great effect.

-   Training and Human Capital Activities Require the Most Investment: Of all the maturity  questions, on average, reporting entities reported the lowest maturity  in Training and Human Capital, as well as Culture and Leadership. These are the two areas that require the most attention across government to increase maturity  and help improve conformance.

The Assessment specifies high-level recommendations to support Section 508 compliance and charts a strategic path forward for enhancing Section 508 compliance across the federal government. [Recommendations](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/2023/recommendations/) include:

-   Congress should consider updating Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act to clearly define the agencies subject to it and modernize its language, terminology and scope; explore options to proactively enforce Section 508 compliance across the federal government; and explore conducting oversight efforts into major providers of ICT to the federal government to determine the best course(s) of action to improve accessibility of high-use products.

-   Relevant oversight and accountability bodies should consider increasing agency oversight of Section 508 compliance while relevant management entities and councils should explore approaches to incorporate and strengthen accessibility metrics in relevant leadership performance measures.

-   Small and micro agency councils, communities of practice, and other interested agencies should explore the creation of a shared service model for Section 508 implementation. A shared service solution may create better, more consistent outcomes across the government. Particularly for participating entities, this solution could increase efficiency and decrease the cost burden on individual organizations.

-   Agencies should follow the ICT Testing Baseline for Web, increase automated and manual Section 508 conformance testing, have an assigned Section 508 PM with utilization and authority that is proportionate and sufficient to ensure an effective Section 508 Program, and require mandatory annual training for roles influencing ICT procurement and development, underlining the importance of incorporating accessibility considerations.

-   Agencies should improve the inclusion of accessibility requirements in procurement and include the needs of users with disabilities in ICT requirements. Current practices often overlook these aspects. 

-   Agencies should include Section 508 program capacity in their annual budget requests, acknowledging that additional resources typically correlate with better conformance.

The FY23 government-wide Section 508 Assessment intends to draw attention to digital accessibility, elevating its importance across reporting entities. During the Assessment's development, many in the digital accessibility community expressed optimism that this new focus will translate into tangible advancements in Section 508 compliance and a stronger commitment to ensuring equal access to ICT and digital services.

Investments and efforts encouraged by the Assessment can lead to significantly improved integration of accessibility into user experiences across all government entities. GSA is committed to supporting all reporting entities with a shared vision of enhancing accessibility and ensuring an inclusive digital world.
