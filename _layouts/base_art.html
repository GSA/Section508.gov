A ten-minute investment of your time using ART can help you avoid untimely delays when attempting to obtain approval later to issue your solicitation:</p><p>Common situations include:</p><ul><li>New Solicitations</li><li>Task Orders under existing contracts (including contracts managed by other agencies)</li><li>ICT that will be provided to the public &amp; internally</li><li>ICT COTS/GOTS licenses</li><li>ICT approved on the TRM</li><li>ICT proof of concepts, pilot efforts, and MVPs</li><li>ICT provided as a service (example &ndash; SaaS, PaaS)</li><li>ICT provided through open source arrangements</li><li>ICT that has an authorized 508 exception</li><li>Services to develop, modify, configure, install, maintain, and host ICT</li><li>Services that produce ICT in support of other deliverables (ex.

ART only asks you to answer questions about what technology products and services you are buying.</p><h2>How should ART be used if a 508 exception applies?</h2><p>ART will ask if any of the technology products have an authorized exception. If you want to claim an exception, you must have an exception authorization # before using ART.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do not already have an authorization and want to request one, use the Accessibility Compliance Management System to make your request.</p><h2>How should ART be used for task and delivery order contract or agreements?</h2><p>You can use ART to create 508 language for task and delivery order contracts and agreements (e.g. blank purchase agreements, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity agreements) when applicable section 508 requirements can be identified at the contract/agreement level.</p><p>If Section 508 requirements cannot be identified because multiple types of ICT and/or ICT services will be available for purchase under the contract or agreement, the ordering procedures for the contract/agreement must require that the section 508 requirements be identified using ART before placing any order.</p><p>See OCPO Acquisition Alert - July 23, 2018 for more information.</p><h2>Can I continue to use the 508 language from previous solicitations?</h2><p>No. DO NOT copy and paste the 508 language used in a previous solicitation. If the Section 508 language in your solicitation refers to&nbsp;Electronic Information Technology (EIT), it will be out of date and will not be approved by OAST.&nbsp;</p><p>Continued use of the old language runs the risk of introducing ambiguity into your solicitation and resulting contract.&nbsp;</p><p>The new 508 language generated by <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/oast/DART/">ART 2.1</a> provides:</p><ul><li>Tailored requirements based on the type of technology products and services being procured.</li><li>Updated legal provisions to ensure accessibility is supported throughout the life of contract, including requirements for the contractor to use the DHS Trusted Tester Process to validate 508 conformance for web and software developed or modified for use by DHS (using contractor trusted testers personnel).</li><li>Provides specific instructions documenting and supporting accessibility claims in bid proposals, and DHS acceptance criteria for validating claims.</li><li>Refer to the Revised 508 language template for more information.</li></ul><h2>Can I create my own Section 508 solicitation language?&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>The DHS Acquisition Manual (HSAM) 3039.204(e)(2)(ii)) requires solicitation language for information and communications technology to include the Section 508 requirements provided using ART, and for any applicable exceptions to 508 to be properly authorized and documented in the contract file.</li><li>Acquisition Alert - July 23, 2018 outlines requirements for including the revised 508 requirements language in new solicitations and existing contracts and agreements.</li></ul><h2>How was the ART Tool created?</h2><ul><li>The Section 508 Solicitation Language generated by <u><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/oast/DART/">ART 2.1</a></u> was developed jointly by the Office of Accessible Systems and Technology, the Office of Acquisition Policy and Legislation, the Office of General Counsel.
