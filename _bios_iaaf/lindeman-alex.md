After working at Denali National Park for many years and developing a variety of skills related to Section 508 in that time, I took a remote job with the NPS Washington, D.C., office in our Information Resources Management Directorate (IRMD), which allowed me to remain in Alaska. One of my current duties is to be the main NPS point of contact for all things Section 508. I maintain many job aids, lead formal and informal trainings, and collaborate regularly with my Section 508 peers across DOIâ€”particularly with our fearless agency Section 508 lead, Sid Sharma. I am an avowed social media curmudgeon but will do my best to represent our social media savant, Matt Turner, and all the NPS employees who work hard to ensure their social media posts are accessible.
