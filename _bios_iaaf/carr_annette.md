Annette Carr is a name that is not new to those in the Section 508 and assistive technology arenas. She is currently the Disability Program Manager (DPM) at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Prior to her arrival at TSA in July 2020, she held the position of Acting DPM for the Department of Transportation (DOT), and before that she was a Reasonable Accommodations Analyst in DOT’s Disability Resource Center (DRC).

Annette’s decades of experience in assistive technology and the rights of people with disabilities, within both the public and private sectors, supports her work at TSA with leading the agency’s Disability Employment program. She works collaboratively with TSA’s Reasonable Accommodation, Selective Placement, Section 508 and Facility Operations Offices to ensure that TSA is a diverse, inclusive and accessible workplace.
