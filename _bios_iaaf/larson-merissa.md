Ms. Larson serves as the Executive Director and Deputy Chief Risk Officer for Compliance, Risk and Remediation within the Office of Information Technology.

Ms. Larson began her federal career with the General Services Administration (GSA) within their Financial Management Leadership Program. Throughout her career, Ms. Larson has worked at the operational, strategic, and executive levels, serving in multiple federal agencies including GSA, the Department of the Navy, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

At the Department of the Navy Ms. Larson was hand-selected to lead the creation of their Wounded Warrior Program from scratch, including the development of the programâ€™s first ever mission, vision, strategic goals and objectives. Then Ms. Larson was selected to a competitive 2-year Defense Senior Executive Leadership Program where she earned an opportunity to attend the Army War College. From there, Ms. Larson served at the Office of the Secretary of Defense within the Office of Personnel and Readiness. She prepared and influenced department wide policy decisions, congressional responses, along with managing inspector general inquiries and reports for corrective actions. Continuing her passion for advocating for service members and their families, transitioning to the Department of Veterans Affairs presented a perfect fit.

Ms. Larson served as the Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor of the Office of IT Resource Management (ITRM) since October 2018 where she leveraged her background in budget, policy development, Human Resources and special projects, which led her to be called upon to lead high-level initiatives for OIT.
