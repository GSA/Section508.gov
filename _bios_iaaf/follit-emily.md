Emily Follit has co-founded and led multiple peer support groups. As a co-founder and Chairperson of the LGBTQ+ & Allies group for Peace Corps Volunteers in Rwanda, Emily saw what an asset these peer groups can be. After Peace Corps, Emily began working at NSF and a few months later, they were diagnosed with PTSD. For Emily, when the opportunity arose to help establish Mental Health Advocates (MHA), it was a no-brainer. Fostering a welcoming and supportive work environment throughout NSF, like they found in EHR/HRD, was an excellent way to give back to the Foundation.
