Dee Dansby, Program Analyst. Dee works for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the Contract Data Management Program (CDMP) under the Deputy Director’s Office (DDO) in the Office of Acquisitions and Logistics Management (OALM). Dee has been with the federal government for over fifteen (15) years. Before her federal service, Dee worked in Corporate America for over twenty-five (25) years.

Dee became the OALM 508 Help Point of Contact (HPOC) in 2009. She partnered with the Trans-OM Section 508 program, where she instructed the Section 508 Interns yearly until June 2020. Presently, Dee is a volunteer instructor for the Center for Information Technology (CIT), where she creates and instructs training programs for Creating Accessible Microsoft Office 365 documents (i.e., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook). She also instructs PDF accessibility.

Her philosophy is “Why reinvent the wheel?” Dee has given the NIH community a one- stop “shopping” center via the CDMP SharePoint and Yammer sites. The sites were developed to encourage staff to utilize and share accessibility training programs, handouts, tools, and resources to ensure Section 508 compliance in their IC’s electronic documents.
