Wendy Cheng works as an Information Technology Specialist for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within their IT Accessibility and Section 508 program.  Prior to this position she served as the FDA Library’s Assistive Technology Coordinator and was chair of the Reasonable Accommodation subcommittee in FDA’s Advisory Committee for Employees with Disabilities (ACED). As a long-time hearing aid and cochlear implant user, captioning of live and recording events is a personal focus with her. Wendy holds a master’s degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Maryland at College Park.

Outside the office, she enjoys playing music (she plays viola and rings handbells) and also runs a small nonprofit for adult musicians with hearing loss.
