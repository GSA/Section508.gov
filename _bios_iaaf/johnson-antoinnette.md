Antoinette “AJ” Johnson has been with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) since 1999 and has been overseeing CMS Section 508 activities since 2018. In her role as CMS’ Section 508 Program Manager assigned back in 2020, AJ led the agency’s mission on accessibility and inclusiveness in government. She has also supported the agency’s IT Governance initiatives; which are aligned with the CMS Administrator’s focus on operational efficiencies. AJ is a steadfast leader in Disability Inclusion as well. With the formal launch of CMS’ Section 508 Program in 2021, AJ was primarily responsible for CMS’ engagements with internal and external stakeholders with a focus on Section 508 Policies issuance, development of 508 accessible trainings and education programs, ensuring accessibility as part of CMS procurements and acquisitions, and ensuring the execution of accessibility validation testing protocols; which all support access for all, including those with disabilities. She is solution-oriented and considers accessibility, inclusion and universal design a cornerstone of any agency’s goals, workforce development, and plan management.
