Larry Gillick is the product manager for all things web in the FDIC’s Office of Communications.
 
You may know him better from a decade at the U.S. Department of the Interior, where he set standards for web and social media and established a common cloud-based Drupal web platform that still hosts DOI.gov and several Interior bureau and office websites (and the Inspector General). He advises other agencies on web and social media issues and enjoys long-term problem solving. Why solve for today, when you can solve for forever?
 
He presents, whenever they let him, at Drupal GovCon – or anywhere that supplies decent coffee.
 
He has an MA from Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communication and will forever be ABT on an MFA in Digital Cinema.
