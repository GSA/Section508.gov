Avis is a Program Analyst for the Office of Government-wide Policy at GSA and has worked at GSA for a long time. She started out as a summer intern and worked her way up in lateral positions. Avis worked on projects within OGP to help her improve and excel in challenging areas. Her background is budgeting, contracting and administrative duties. She presently serves as Assistant to the Director, for Training Outreach on the IT Accessibility team, and serves as a Contracting Officer Representative.

During the pandemic, Avis took the opportunity to go to school for Massage Therapy, something very passionate to her heart. She thought this was a perfect time to cross something off of her bucket list. Avis graduated in April 2021 and passed the MBLEX exam. She will soon be a licensed Massage Therapist.
