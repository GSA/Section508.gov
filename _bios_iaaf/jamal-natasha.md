Natasha Jamal serves as the Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) at the US Digital Service, where she advises on integrating DEIA principles into all aspects of the USDS culture and service delivery. In November of 2022, she co-created the inaugural DEIA Council at USDS, comprised of 14 individuals across 5 Communities of Practice, to advise the organization on tangible ways to elevate and integrate DEIA.  Related to accessibility specifically, Natasha serves as the sponsor for a recently created USDS team focused on accessible service delivery for the public, the first of its kinds at USDS. Prior to joining USDS and government, Natasha created the DEI and Culture Transformation practices at Gallup and leverages her experience in creating culture change to work across various stakeholder groups to push for big and small changes across USDS and government at large.
