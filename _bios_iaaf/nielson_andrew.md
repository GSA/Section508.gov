Andrew is the Director of the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program in GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy, which has the mandate, under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to provide technical assistance to federal agencies and individuals in meeting Section 508 requirements. Andrew is an expert in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) accessibility. He is Co-Chair of the annual ICT Accessibility Testing Symposium, which brings together other experts from around the world in the field of ICT accessibility testing to exchange academic analysis of current ICT accessibility testing issues and explore approaches to improve accessibility testing practices. He is a principal co-author of the current version of the Harmonized Processes for Revised Section 508: Baseline Tests for Web Accessibility (aka the "ICT Baseline"). Andrew was also the coordinator and facilitator of the inter-agency team of experts that developed both the Baseline and the current version of the "Trusted Tester" accessibility testing process, which is recognized across the federal government as a leading practice in accessibility testing.
