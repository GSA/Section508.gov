Jessie Weber is Managing Partner at Brown, Goldstein & Levy, LLP (“BGL”), where she works on a range of civil litigation matters nationwide, with a focus on disability rights, fair housing, workplace justice, and appellate litigation. She has successfully litigated and resolved cases involving accessible technology and document formats, voting rights for individuals with print disabilities, access to health care and educational opportunities, and employment discrimination. She represents blind students and the National Federation of the Blind in litigation against the Los Angeles Community College District, and obtained a jury verdict finding LACCD violated plaintiffs’ rights under Title II of the ADA by denying them an equal educational experience, including through the use of inaccessible technology. 

Before joining BGL, Ms. Weber was a Francis D. Murnaghan, Jr. Appellate Advocacy Fellow at the Public Justice Center where she worked on issues affecting marginalized communities. Before that, she served as a law clerk for Judge Catherine C. Blake of the US District Court for the District of Maryland. 

She serves as president of the board of Disability Rights Maryland and previously served on the boards of the ACLU of Maryland and FreeState Justice. 

Ms. Weber obtained her AB from Princeton University and her JD from Yale Law School.
