Moore, PhD received her PhD in Cultural and Medical Anthropology at Stanford University and postdoctoral training in Behavioral Science in the Psychiatry Department at Stanford Medical School, in Clinical Ethnography and Epidemiology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Hospice/Palliative Care at St. Austell’s in the UK. Her work combines anthropological methods, ethics, data science and clinical medicine to better understand patient experiences and data disparities across culturally and medically diverse care settings (cancer, pain, palliative care, Neurodiversity), gamification, community engaged research, and the differential and ethical impacts of new and emerging technologies on individuals and communities in vulnerable situations in low resource settings and in low and middle income countries (e.g. AI, Digital Health, etc.,).

Rhonda is author and editor of the following books: Climate Change and Health Equity (Forthcoming, Springer 2023), Handbook of Pain and Palliative Care (Springer, 2012, 2nd edition, Springer, 2019), Biobehavioral Approaches to Pain (Springer 2009) and Cancer Culture and Communication (Springer 2004). Currently, she is a Program Officer with the Center for Global Mental Health at NIH’s National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH). Areas of responsibility include Social Drivers of Global Mental Health, ethics of new and emerging technologies, climate change and mental health, citizen science, and Neurodiversity at work. She is the Program lead for the Digital Global Mental Health program.
