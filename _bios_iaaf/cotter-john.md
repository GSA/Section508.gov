John Cotter graduated from Towson University with a BS in computer science and began his career as a web developer at SSA in 2004. John excelled in front-end web development and was responsible for Section 508 compliance for many web apps. John created ANDI in 2017: During a detail with SSA's 508 Program, John researched discrepancies with screen reader speech. Out of curiosity, John generated hundreds of test cases and recorded screen reader output. John coded an algorithm to capture his observations. He shared his results with SSA's 508 Program Manager who recognized that what John had "discovered" already had a name: the Accessible Name and Description Computation. John was encouraged to turn his research into a tool which became ANDI, the Accessible Name and Description Inspector. ANDI quickly became the primary tool for manual accessibility testing among SSA 508 testers. John open-sourced ANDI and shared it with interagency groups who worked to make it the recommended tool for the Trusted Tester Conformance Test Process. 

John is the 508 subject matter expert for the SSA Design System team, whose primary product is the User Experience Framework (UEF), a web component library used internally by SSA. John ensures that UEF web components are 508 compliant so that web apps that use UEF are "accessible by default".John's ability to investigate issues and provide solutions is second to none, and vital to the success of his agency's goal of Section 508 conformance.
