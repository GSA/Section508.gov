Bethany Letalien (she/her) has spent the last several years standing up the Office of Personnel Management’s small but mighty Section 508 program office, housed within the Office of Communications. Bethany is Trusted Tester certified and has been active in the ICT testing baseline efforts for web and documents led by GSA, the Access Board, and the Accessible Electronic Documents Community of Practice (AED COP).

Like many Section 508 specialists, Bethany fell into her current role. She has a background in Brazilian studies, web design dating back to the 1990s, and animal rescue. When she started at OPM as a Presidential Management Fellow in 2009, she knew only that she would be placed in the office of the Chief Information Officer. She worked in four OPM offices on open government, open data, records management, plain language, and various related projects before going full-time on Section 508. Before working for OPM, Bethany used her knowledge of the Portuguese language while employed by the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress and conducted field work in Rio de Janeiro.

Bethany lives with her dog, Otis Blood Pressure Elevator (who refuses to allow her to foster other dogs) in Maryland, where they both enjoy eating from the garden.

Bethany holds a BSLA from Georgetown University and two MAs, an MSIS, and a PhD from the University of Texas at Austin. She maintains that the reason she has so many degrees is she couldn’t decide what she wanted to be when she grew up. She’s finally figured it out.
