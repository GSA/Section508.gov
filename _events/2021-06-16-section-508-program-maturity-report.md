The <a href ="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/strategic-plan-508-compliance.pdf" target="_blank"> OMB Strategic Plan for Improving Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</a> aims to improve how agencies manage Section 508 and IT accessibility responsibilities by increasing transparency, strengthening accountability, and improving collaboration.

Federal agencies are required to report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) twice per year on their IT accessibility/Section 508 program maturity and effectiveness. The CIO Council’s Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) and GSA’s Government-wide IT Accessibility Program analyze these reports to find ways to improve collaboration across agencies, reduce redundancies, and develop solutions to improve the management of government accessibility programs.

**Target Audience:** Section 508 Program Managers  
**Reporting Periods:** Reports are due twice per year, in February and August
