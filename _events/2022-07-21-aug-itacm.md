The next IT Accessibility Community Meeting is a virtual event scheduled for **Tuesday, August 16, 2022**. Our overall theme, ***"Be The Change In Accessibility,”*** focuses on “being the change” while reconnecting with our broader accessibility community members and charting the path forward. 

The topic for this session is “Be The Change In Accessibility: Policy & Management.” First, you’ll hear an overview of findings from the Section 508 Program Maturity Report including trends, successes, challenges and recommendations in meeting the IT accessibility needs of people with disabilities.
 
Then, you’ll have an opportunity to get an answer to that burning IT accessibility question you’ve always wanted to ask during an “office hours” session with a panel of Accessibility Subject Matter Experts. Prior to the session, you will have the opportunity to identify questions or challenges you have experienced in your day-to-day work. Panelists will discuss these topics and provide concrete recommendations on how to address them.
