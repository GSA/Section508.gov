Maps are important tools in providing information about the world. They help us travel from one location to another, organize information and orient ourselves so that we can determine where we are and how to get to where we want to go. Federal and state agencies use maps to inform members of the public, policy makers, and to assist agency employees in conducting their missions by providing vital information. Online maps, designed without accessibility features, present barriers to individuals with disabilities.

This session will introduce the concept, development, tools, and benefits of creating and using accessible maps. Presenters from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources of the State of Minnesota will discuss how they create accessible maps in different formats to meet their missions of informing and educating the public. Presenters will also review some barriers, solutions, and implications to making accessible data visualizations.

During this webinar, presenters will share the following information.  

* Common barriers to accessing maps for users with disabilities.
* Useful design principles that make maps easier to use.
* Best practices for creating accessible static digital maps.
* Designs to ensure interactive web maps can be used by a mouse, keyboard, or voice commands.

This session is intended for entry-level to intermediate audiences, but all are welcome to join. This webinar will include video remote interpreting (VRI) and real-time captioning. Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
