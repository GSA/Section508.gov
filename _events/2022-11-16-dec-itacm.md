The next IT Accessibility Community Meeting virtual event scheduled for Tuesday, December 6, 2022. This will be a special meeting as we celebrate the superhero in you.

First, you’ll hear what Center for Desease Control and Prevention (CDC) is doing currently and planning around the need for accessible communication that is plain, clear, and inclusive.  Some examples of recent work will also be shared..

Second, our understanding of the world around us is shaped by our perspective, and so is our understanding of what we call disabilities.  If we can get past the labels we’ve imposed on others, we’ll realize the truly amazing things people can do. We’ll recognize that people with disabilities are also the ones with superpowers!
