## About IAAF
The annual Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) provides a venue for federal accessibility professionals, developers, designers, project managers, leadership and many others to exchange best practices in managing and implementing digital accessibility imperatives including Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. 

## Thank You!

Over the coming months, we’ll publish videos of key sessions to ensure everyone has access to the insights and discussions, especially for those who couldn’t attend the event. Stay updated by visiting the [IAAF Archives]({{site.baseurl}}/iaaf/archives).
