## About IAAF
The annual Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) provides a venue for federal accessibility professionals, developers, designers, project managers, leadership and many others to exchange best practices in managing and implementing digital accessibility imperatives including Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. 

## Thank You!
Thank you to all presenters and attendees for making this year’s Interagency Accessibility Forum a success. Your contributions and discussions on advancing Section 508 compliance, from digital accessibility tools to social media inclusivity and strategic frameworks, have been invaluable. Together, you've made strides toward a more accessible future in federal technology.

Over the coming months, we’ll publish videos of key sessions to ensure everyone has access to the insights and discussions, especially for those who couldn’t attend the event. Stay updated by visiting the [IAAF Archives]({{site.baseurl}}/iaaf/archives).

## Let's Keep the Momentum Going into 2025!
Mark your calendars for the 12th Annual Interagency Accessibility Forum, scheduled for **May 20-22, 2025, at the National Science Foundation** where you'll participate in an exciting lineup of sessions, workshops, and networking opportunities!

The 2025 IAAF at NSF will return as an in-person conference, with a virtual attendance option for those who are unable to travel. NSF is easily accessible by public transportation as it is directly adjacent to the Eisenhower Avenue Metro Station and surrounded by public parking and a variety of restaurants and eateries.

Registration will open in the Spring, so mark your calendars today and watch Section508.gov/IAAF for announcements and event information.

Until then, let's continue to collaborate, innovate, and advocate for a more accessible digital world. Together, we can create a future where everyone has equal access to information and technology.
