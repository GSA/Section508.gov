## About IAAF 2021 

The 2021 Interagency Accessibility Forum celebrated the 75th observance of the National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) and the 20th anniversary of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act becoming enforceable.

Attendees of this year’s IAAF will hear presentations and panel discussions that will focus on accessibility as a foundation for inclusion, diversity, and equity within the federal government. In addition, the forum will include virtual exhibitions by accessibility consultants and IT companies with accessibility products and services that support those with disabilities.

The 2021 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) is sponsored by the Federal Chief Information Officer Council’s (Federal CIO Council) Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) and hosted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program from the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) of the General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Labor (DOL), and Merit Service Protection Board (MSPB), in partnership with other federal agencies.

### IAAF Archives
Since 2013, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) along with federal agency partners has hosted the annual Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) for agency representatives to learn about federal accessibility policies and how they can adapt Section 508 standards to prioritize IT accessibility.

Over the years, conference attendees have heard from a range of presenters, panelists, and keynote speakers across a variety of topics, perspectives, and experiences. Notable speakers include former and active members of Congress, commission chairs and other senior leaders within government and the accessibility community.
