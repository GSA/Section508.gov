## About IAAF 2021 

The 2021 Interagency Accessibility Forum celebrated the 75th observance of the National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) and the 20th anniversary of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act becoming enforceable.

Attendees of this year’s IAAF will hear presentations and panel discussions that will focus on accessibility as a foundation for inclusion, diversity, and equity within the federal government. In addition, the forum will include virtual exhibitions by accessibility consultants and IT companies with accessibility products and services that support those with disabilities.

The 2021 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) is sponsored by the Federal Chief Information Officer Council’s (Federal CIO Council) Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) and hosted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program from the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) of the General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Labor (DOL), and Merit Service Protection Board (MSPB), in partnership with other federal agencies.

<h3 id="exhibitor">Exhibitor Information</h3>
<p><strong>What:</strong> As this year&rsquo;s Forum is virtual, there will not be a traditional exhibit space. The forum will include two options for our accessibility Exhibitors to demonstrate their products and services. Option 1 is to submit a pre-recorded 5-minute video that will be run as an &ldquo;Ad&rdquo; during the breaks of the event. There is space for 12 exhibitors to submit for Option 1. Option 2 is a 10-minute live presentation during the third day of the event. There will be four simultaneous exhibitor breakouts. Participants will be able to select which they would like to view.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> The virtual &ldquo;Ads&rdquo; from Option 1 will be run throughout our 3-day event from October 12 - 14. The exhibitor break-outs will take place on October 14th in two sessions (1:00 P.M. and 3:00 P.M.). Each exhibitor will be provided a 10-minute time slot in which to present an overview of their products and services. Day and session will be selected by the IAAF Host Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> IAAF 2021 will be a 100% virtual event hosted on Zoom for Government.</p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong> IT technology vendors, companies, and associations that build accessible products or accessibility support services, are invited to participate.</p>
<h3>Exhibitor Registration Specifics</h3>
<p>Exhibitor registration is free on a first-come, first-serve basis and will be capped at 12 exhibitors for Option 1 (pre-recorded video) and 24 exhibitors for Option 2 (live breakout presentation). <strong>You may only select ONE of these options.</strong> If your company registers for both options, our team will select one for you. Once exhibitor capacity is reached, vendor registration will be closed. Vendors that are not among the 36 exhibitors are welcome to register and attend the full IAAF as attendees.</p>

### IAAF Archives
Since 2013, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) along with federal agency partners has hosted the annual Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) for agency representatives to learn about federal accessibility policies and how they can adapt Section 508 standards to prioritize IT accessibility.

Over the years, conference attendees have heard from a range of presenters, panelists, and keynote speakers across a variety of topics, perspectives, and experiences. Notable speakers include former and active members of Congress, commission chairs and other senior leaders within government and the accessibility community.
