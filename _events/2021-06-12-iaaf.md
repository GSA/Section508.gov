## About IAAF 2021 

The 2021 Interagency Accessibility Forum celebrated the 75th observance of the National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) and the 20th anniversary of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act becoming enforceable.

Attendees of this year’s IAAF will hear presentations and panel discussions that will focus on accessibility as a foundation for inclusion, diversity, and equity within the federal government. In addition, the forum will include virtual exhibitions by accessibility consultants and IT companies with accessibility products and services that support those with disabilities.

The 2021 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) is sponsored by the Federal Chief Information Officer Council’s (Federal CIO Council) Accessibility Community of Practice (ACOP) and hosted by the Government-wide IT Accessibility Program from the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) of the General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Labor (DOL), and Merit Service Protection Board (MSPB), in partnership with other federal agencies.
