Our second IT Accessibility Community Meeting of the year will be a virtual event scheduled for Tuesday, April 25, 2023. Our overall theme, "Let’s Take Flight  & Continue To Soar” focuses on “continuing the meaningful work through unending leadership by example and being the change we want to see ” while reconnecting with our broader accessibility community members and charting the path forward. 

As we Continue To Soar this year, we will experience trips on Flight 508 to various destinations.  Like Flight attendants, Section 508 Program managers and team members meet and greet passengers constantly explaining the rules that must be adhered to for a safe flight.  Section 508 Program Offices are crucial to this effort.  Join us to hear how the US Census Bureau discusses their experience in standing up a Section 508 Program Office.  What led a group of 508 Team members to embark on their flight to bring Section 508 awareness to their agency?

The reality is, what we work on can change daily and no two weeks are alike.  Take part in one of their team flights as they navigate challenges, provide guidance, explore critical solutions and keep the agency engaged in Section 508.

You will also have an opportunity to take part in an in-flight journey with one of our soaring Section 508 Superheroes, who will share their accessibility experience.
