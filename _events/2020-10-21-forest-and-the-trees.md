The increase in virtual course content, combined with the recent lawsuits at Harvard and MIT and updates to Section 508, have pushed online accessibility into the forefront of higher education awareness. With the advent of global accessibility standards and the push for uniformity in online accessibility, the University of Connecticut is in the process of developing its own standards for universal digital accessibility. As a result of this discussion, participants will learn to incorporate consideration of policies, automated and manual compliance testing, and training for various skill levels of web content authors into enterprise-level accessibility plans. Participants will also gain understanding of how institutional accessibility impacts the procurement process and pre-existing standalone digital products.
