The General Services Administration's (GSA) Government-wide IT Accessibility Program will host the first bimonthly IT Accessibility Community Meeting of the year on Tuesday, February 13, 2024, from 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM ET.

During the meeting, federal employees and others will learn how to use the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/manage/policy-framework/introduction/">IT Accessibility Policy Framework</a> to improve the conformance of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). The framework is designed to help attendees evaluate and update their agency's IT accessibility policies and procedures.

Following an overview of the framework, attendees will apply their newfound knowledge in an instructor-led workshop where they will use the <a href="https://assets.section508.gov/assets/files/Policy+Review+Template.xlsx" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Policy Review Template (XLXS)</a> workbook to assess sample policies.

Registered participants will receive copies of sample policies and the <a href="https://assets.section508.gov/assets/files/Policy+Review+Template.xlsx" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Policy Review Template (XLSX)</a> workbook in their registration confirmation email.

This presentation and workshop supports the "comprehensive assessment of agency policies" action required of federal agencies by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Strengthening Digital Accessibility and the Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (M-24-08)</a>.

**To maximize the benefit of this training, participants should review the sample policies before the event as little time will be allocated for initial reading.**
