Procurement and accessibility go together like peanut butter and jelly. Procurement is a fancy way of saying “personal shopper.” It may seem like a daunting process but with the right tools and attitude, it can be a fun experience. This webinar will provide an informative and consumable discussion on the acquisition lifecycle. In addition, there will be a particular emphasis on how accessibility fits into the lifecycle, stakeholder roles and responsibilities, and useful tools. Finally, the presenters will guide attendees through the process using a “real life scenario”, providing a foundation that can be applied to any information and communication technology (ICT) buy.

Target audience is anyone involved and/or interested in accessibility, procurement, or both (i.e. everyone)

Questions can be submitted in advance of the session or can be posed during the live webinar.
