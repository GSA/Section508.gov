We bring together experts from the fields of accessibility and legal to discuss current trends, and to provide insights that will be helpful to practitioners in their work on digital accessibility. One of our original plans was to alternate from West Coast to East Coast each year. The switch to online changed that for 2020. For 2021, we are going back to the original intent of holding the event on the East Coast, with a face to face event at the American University Washington College of Law, in Washington, D.C. However, as the ongoing situation has showed us that there is no clear end in sight, we will remain flexible. The event could end up being a combination of face to face and online.
