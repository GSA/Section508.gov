## About IAAF 2023
Our teams are busy making plans for the 2023 Interagency Accessibility Forum (IAAF) and to celebrate accessibility as the foundation for the Federal Government to serve as a model where all employees are treated with dignity and respect. While additional planning is needed before we're able to share event details, the 2023 IAAF will be held on November 7 -9, 2023.
