The next IT Accessibility Community Meeting is a virtual event scheduled for **Tuesday, June 14, 2022**. Our overall theme, ***"Be The Change In Accessibility,”*** focuses on “being the change” while reconnecting with our broader accessibility community members and charting the path forward.

The topic for this session is “Be The Change In Accessibility: Acquisition” where you’ll hear from our speakers.  Join us to hear about the federal acquisition processes for procuring Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and how these processes provide key opportunities to ensure accessible technology is being purchased.

Gain a better understanding of accessible acquisitions from a two-part presentation:

* The first, Accessibility Through The Acquisition Lifecycle, details the steps that agencies use when acquiring ICT
* The second presentation, Demystifying Section 508/ICT Accessibility, focuses on how industry developing accessible ICT is a win-win situation for industry and the government

We invite you to walk through the key acquisition lifecycle stages with our presenters, discuss how to incorporate ICT accessibility requirements into purchasing, and share general accessible acquisition best practices.
