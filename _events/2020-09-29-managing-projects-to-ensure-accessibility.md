Ensuring that accessibility is accounted for and managed throughout the various steps of the federal information technology procurement lifecycle can be challenging and confusing. The General Service Administration's Government-wide IT Accessibility Program Director, John Sullivan, and accessible acquisition expert, Andrew Nielson will provide information on how to position federal agencies to ensure accessible information and communications technologies (ICT) are procured and managed for their agencies. Presenters will address how to establish accessibility requirements, what contract terms and conditions are important to include in a solicitation, how to evaluate vendor claims for accessibility, and how to manage through the contract life and ensure that ICT remains accessible as software or websites versions are upgraded and contracts are modified.
