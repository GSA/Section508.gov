Section508.gov is a website about IT accessibility in the Federal government.

We&rsquo;ve recently redesigned this website, and it looks like the page you want has moved. Sorry about that. Let&rsquo;s get you back on track! What were you trying to do?
<ul>
  <li><a href="/test">Learn about accessibility testing</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tools">Find IT Accessibility Training</a></li>
  <li><a href="/manage/laws-and-policies">Learn about Section 508 policy</a></li>
  <li><a href="/buy">Purchase accessible IT products or services</a></li>
  <li><a href="/manage">Find information for IT Accessibility program managers</a></li>
  <li><a href="/sell/vpat">Learn about VPAT&trade;</a></li>
</ul>
If none of these options seem to fit, please try our site search, visit the <a href=“{{site.baseurl}}”>Section508.gov homepage</a>, or <a href=“mailto:section.508@gsa.gov”>email us with your question</a>.
