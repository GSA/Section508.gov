        subtitle: 'Using Technology to Enhance Intersectional Neurodiverse Accessibility at Work'
        description: Neurodiversity/Neurodivergence has been defined the range of differences in individual brain function and behavioral traits, regarded as part of normal variation in the human population.  Neurodiversity also describes the idea that people experience and interact with the world around them in many different ways; there is no one "right" way of thinking, learning, and behaving, and differences are not viewed as deficits ( Singer 2016, Mottron 2004, Harvard 2022). As more companies broaden their investment in DEIA programs, more leaders are adding neuodiversity/neurodivergence to their business vocabularies and programming (DICE, 2021). However, while a growing number of companies are still refining HR processes to hire and retain neurodivere talent; at present, however,  there are still many barriers and more work needs to be done. This panel will briefly discuss what intersectional neurodiversity means, the business case for neurodiversity, how each panelist is expanding accessibility though technology for DEIA and for Neurodiverse people with the workplace, how success is measured, best practices and next steps to create  holistic inclusive workplaces.

            description: Struggling with human emotions is a universal experience, yet mental health is a topic that gets stigmatized every day in our society. Mental health awareness is on the rise, particularly as COVID-19 continues to drive an epidemic of stress and burnout. That's why it's more important than ever for companies to prioritize employee well-being and mental health. This presents unique challenges in the workplace, going beyond just providing mental health options to creating a workplace in which all employees truly feel supported by employers and connected to one another. This presentation will share one agency's efforts to establish a work culture that embraces mental health, talks about it, and supports employee mental health through the establishment of an Employee Resource Group accessible to all employees and contractors within the National Science Foundation.

            track_id: day2breakout2a
            description: For our new ONRR.gov site, we wanted to ensure the site is accessible from the start. We decided to use a four-point hybrid testing approach. The first step is running automated Lighthouse accessibility reports. We followed up with manual testing with NVDA screen reader. We then worked with a SME with visual disability to review the website. Finally, we iterated the needed fixes with our developer. We'll present learnings from this process.

Each mission, usually no more than 5 minutes, is focused on one of the following areas ':' Vision, Hearing, Mobility, Speech, and Cognitive. Those participating report out if they completed it and any other observations. It can help people walk in someone else's shoe while learning about features they may not have been aware of (e.g., dictation, and using short cut keys)."
