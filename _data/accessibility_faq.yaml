  q: I don't have much free time, can I find resources specifically targeted at my role within my agency? 
  a: |
    Currently [section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/) is broken down by type of content not role. However, certain content is targeted for specific roles. For instance, [the technology accessibility playbook](https://www.section508.gov/manage/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook-intro/) is targeted solely for designers and developers, while the [broader policy and management section](https://www.section508.gov/manage/) is primarily targeted at Section 508 Program Managers (PMs) and agency IT executives.

  q: Do ICT products I buy need to be accessible?
  a: |
    Yes. Subpart 39.2 of the FAR states that:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and</li>
      <li>Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from an agency have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.</li>
    </ol>

  q: For accessibility conformance reports, does partially support mean the ICT product or software is conformant or not?
  a: |
    When a product supports a relevant accessibility standard, it means that the functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation. If it only partially supports the criterion, then some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion. Thus, an assessment of "partially supports" technically means that the product is not conformant to the standard in question.

  q: How can I verify and validate the ICT product I am buying or selling is accessible?
  a: |
    Verification that an IT product is accessible before or after purchase can usually be done using an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR), also sometimes referred to as test/tests results or as a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template that is essentially the template users fill out to create an ACR). Industry is expected to test its products against the applicable Section 508 Technical Standards and then report the test results indicating which standards the product supports, partially supports, or does not support. This is so agencies can consider accessibility when purchasing the product. If the product supports all the applicable Section 508 Technical Standards, the product is considered compliant with Section 508. If a product does not have an ACR, purchasers are highly encourage to request one from the vendor before purchase.

  q: How do I know which product is the most accessible?
  a: |
    If a purchaser must choose between several ICT products, they should compare the products' Accessibility Conformance Reports against one another to determine which product is the most accessible (i.e., has the highest conformance to related Section 508 standards). When ICT that fully conforms to the Revised 508 Standards is not commercially available, procure ICT that conforms best with the Standards and is consistent with meeting the agency’s business needs. For federal government ICT, this exception can only be claimed by federal agencies and components.

  q: What do we need in a baseline Section 508/ICT Accessibility policy?
  a: |
    The cornerstone of an accessibility program is an agency-wide Section 508 policy. The policy must identify how the agency will manage accessibility compliance through technology acquisition, development, authoring, configuration, deployment, and maintenance activities. The policy must define clear roles and responsibilities. The policy must clarify the authorities and shared responsibility with other agency stakeholders for implementing Section 508 across the agency.
