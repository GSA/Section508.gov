  id: 13
  q: How will reported data be used?
  a: |
    GSA, in consultation with OMB, will prepare and submit to Congress a comprehensive assessment that includes information identifying the metrics and data collected, compliance by each agency, and by the federal government generally, a detailed description of the actions, activities, and other efforts made by GSA over the year preceding to support compliance at agencies and any planned efforts in the coming year to improve compliance at agencies, and a list of recommendations that agencies or Congress may take to help support that compliance.

    The goals of GSA's analysis are to:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Gain a deeper understanding of the state of ICT accessibility across the federal Government</li>
      <li>Identify opportunities to educate the workforce, and reduce redundancies, remediation, and waste</li>
      <li>Improve collaboration across agencies, develop common solutions, and enable future shared services; and</li>
      <li>Inform recommendations that improve the implementation and management of Section 508 across the federal government to ensure that people with disabilities have equitable access to information and data.</li>
    </ol>

    GSA and OMB will evaluate and approximate agency maturity across the following core dimensions:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>IT Accessibility Program Office</strong> - Measuring how well program governance, risk management, and compliance is managed.</li>
      <li><strong>Policies, Procedures, and Standards</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies establish, integrate, and comply with policies, procedures, and standards that support ICT accessibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications</strong> - Measuring how well agencies communicate and monitor all ICT accessibility program activities, including tracking and resolving non-compliance issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Creation</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies make their digital content (e.g., websites, documents, video and other media, social media, electronic forms, and digital signatures) accessible.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership</strong> - Measuring your agency's leadership and professional development and how ICT accessibility is integrated into mission-related strategic planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Technology Lifecycle Activities</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies incorporate ICT accessibility requirements into enterprise architecture, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing and Validation</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies conduct testing and validation of ICT accessibility and Section 508 conformance claims.</li>
      <li><strong>Acquisition and Procurement</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies include, review, and validate contracts for ICT accessibility compliance requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Training</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies train stakeholders on roles and responsibilities related to compliance with Section 508 practices and requirements.</li>
    </ol>

    The report will be submitted to Congress no later than December 29. The report will also be made available on a public website.

    Submitted agency data will be maintained in a publicly available, machine readable format (i.e. as a 44 U.S.C 3502 (20) open Government data asset). Other organizations may choose to use this data for their own purposes.

  q: How do I estimate Full Time Equivalents (FTEs)?
  a: |
    When reporting the total number of full-time equivalents (FTEs) your agency has in its Section 508 Program office or equivalent, this number should reflect the FTEs of individuals who directly support the activities of the Section 508 Program office or equivalent, and not individuals responsible for accessibility as a matter of practice within their regular duties in other organizational business units. 

    When it is not possible to ascertain the number of employee or contractor hours being spent on the agency Section 508 Program office or equivalent, please estimate. Determine the percentage of 508 work being performed on the contract, then apply this percentage to the total cost of the contract, and divide that dollar value by the average cost of each FTE.

  q: How is the assessment laid out?
  a: |
    This is a self-report assessment with 11 dimensions which are categorized as:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>General Information</strong> questions ask about information and metrics related to the activities of your agency's Section 508 Program’s (or equivalent) activities.</li>
      <li><strong>IT Accessibility Program Office</strong> - Measuring how well program governance, risk management, and compliance is managed.</li>
      <li><strong>Policies, Procedures, and Standards</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies establish, integrate, and comply with policies, procedures, and standards that support ICT accessibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications</strong> - Measuring how well agencies communicate and monitor all ICT accessibility program activities, including tracking and resolving non-compliance issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Creation</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies make their digital content (e.g., websites, documents, video and other media, social media, electronic forms, and digital signatures) accessible.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Capital, Culture, and Leadership</strong> - Measuring your agency's leadership and professional development and how ICT accessibility is integrated into mission-related strategic planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Technology Lifecycle Activities</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies incorporate ICT accessibility requirements into enterprise architecture, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, and maintenance.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing and Validation</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies conduct testing and validation of ICT accessibility and Section 508 conformance claims.</li>
      <li><strong>Acquisition and Procurement</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies include, review, and validate contracts for ICT accessibility compliance requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Training</strong> - Measuring the extent to which agencies train stakeholders on roles and responsibilities related to compliance with Section 508 practices and requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Conformance Metrics</strong> that measure how well your agency’s ICT meets technical standards for accessibility, including websites, electronic documents, and multimedia</li>
    </ol>

  id: 16
  q: How do I determine frequency of activities?
  a: |
    <ol type="a">
      <li><strong>Never</strong>: 0%</li>
      <li><strong>Sometimes/Some</strong>: Activities that are performed approximately 1%-24% of the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Regularly</strong>: Activities that are performed approximately 25%-59% of the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Frequently</strong>: Activities that are performed approximately 60%-89% of the time.</li>
      <li><strong>Almost always</strong>: Activities that are performed approximately 90% or more of the time.</li>
    </ol>

    **NOTE** that the scale of frequency is not an evenly distributed linear scale.

    A specific range is provided for each response (e.g., "25% to 59%"); it is not expected that your agency tracks the exact percentage for every item in the assessment (e.g., "Yes, my agency does XYZ 59.75% of the time, so that's 'Frequently'"). Your agency can make an estimate based on your agency's collective experience (e.g., "Yes, my agency does XYZ more than half the time – maybe even a bit more than half of the time. I think this is something my agency does 'Frequently'").

    **Subjectivity and Interpretation**

    Many of the question responses contain multiple items which may be difficult to assess as individual elements. For example, one of the responses for Question 55 is:

    "d) Contract deliverables that are required to be Section 508 conformant are frequently verified prior to acceptance, including required remediation when necessary."

    There are two parts to this response option: verification, and remediation. Are both items done 'Frequently'? Is verification 'frequent' and remediation is 'almost always'? There may be cases where there is not an exact answer, but please provide your agency’s best estimation of what happens in practice.

    **Agency Goals versus Practice**

    Please select the most appropriate response for what happens in practice at your agency. For example, one of the responses for Question 46 is:

    "c) Agency requires a standard Section 508 conformance validation test process in formal policy and web content testers regularly follow the required test process.”

    If it is true that your agency includes this requirement in formal policy, but in actual practice web content testers sometimes follow the required test process, please select the response that aligns with your agency practice rather than the requirement. In this situation, your agency response will be b) (Sometimes) rather than c) (Regularly) because the former more accurately reflects day to day activities.

  a: |
    To update the list of agency/component dropdowns within the designee registration tool, please contact <Section.508@gsa.gov>. You may also select "Other" in the registration link for your agency POC/designee; a text field is presented on the next page for you to input the appropriate agency/component.
-  
  id: 22
  q: Can one point of contact (POC) submit responses for multiple components within the agency?
  a: |
    Yes. The same POC can register for multiple agencies but each agency will have its own specific link to the online response tool. The designated POC will need to ensure the correct link is used to report agency-specific responses.
-  
  id: 23
  q: What happens if my agency does not submit answers by the August 11th deadline?
  a: |
    Agencies that fail to complete the assessment by the deadline will be listed as non-responsive; which will be conveyed to Congress in the summary report.
-  
  id: 24
  q: Can more than one individual register as the agency point of contact (POC) and have access to the response tool?
  a: |
    Please limit agency registration to one POC per agency. Once your agency POC has submitted thier information in the POC registration tool, they will receive a unique link for your agency's report submission. Once the response tool link is opened, the tool will lock to that specific user. To unlock the response tool for a different user, you must contact GSA at <Section.508@gsa.gov> for a manual unlock.

    GSA has not yet drafted an outline. GSA anticipates similarities to the most recent DOJ/GSA report but with additional narrative text. GSA anticipates the report will include data visualizations, diagrams, and narrative analysis to accompany recommendations.
-  
  id: 26
  q: When will agency response(s) be available to the “parent” agencies and how will access to the responses be provided?
  a: |
    When responses are submitted, GSA will receive notice from the online response tool. GSA will then package those responses to provide parent agencies on a yet-to-be-determined regular basis.
-  
  id: 27
  q: Will agencies be able to send segments of questions to appropriate agency responders or will there be online capability to assign certain questions to agency stakeholders for aompletion?
  a: |
    No, the reporting tool will not have the functionality to be able to portion out different sections of questions for other individuals to submit responses. Each agency should coordinate information gathering outside of the response tool for the agency point of contact to submit on behalf of their agency.
-  
  id: 28
  q: Will additional office hours be available?
  a: |
    Yes, GSA anticipates having office hours through early August, though the frequency may vary. Please continue to check the <a href="../../../events/" target="_blank">Events page</a> page as office hours are scheduled.
