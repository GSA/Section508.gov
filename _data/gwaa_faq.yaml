  h: Overview
  q: Am I required to fill out this assessment?
  a: |
    All federal departments or agencies covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are required to fill out the annual Governmentwide Section 508 Assessment (referred to as the “Assessment” from this point forwards).

  h: Overview
  q: Are all questions required?
  a: |
    Yes, all questions are required. However, some questions depend on previous answers and will not be shown if they do not apply to your reporting entity. For example, if you select that your reporting entity does not use automated testing tools, you will not receive additional questions about automated testing tools.

  q: What are the primary differences between the FY23 criteria and the FY24 criteria?
  a: |
    Most of the criteria remained unchanged in intent but language has been modified for clarity and answer selections have been truncated. Additional changes include:
    <ul>
      <li>Questions have been renumbered throughout.</li>
      <li>All questions are required, however question dependencies apply.</li>
      <li>“Reporting entity” is used instead of “agency”.</li>
      <li>Frequency has been added directly to response options for clarity in never, sometimes, regularly, frequently, and almost always.</li>
      <li>When a timeframe is needed for reporting, the reporting period has been added directly to applicable questions.</li>
      <li>Several new criteria have been added including:
        <ul>
          <li>Q1 asks for the total number of total federal employees within the reporting entity</li>
          <li>Q9 asks about other ICT test processes used within the reporting entity.</li>
          <li>Q19-22 asks several questions to better understand the exceptions process.</li>
          <li>Q23 asks about how contractors are assessed for capabilities related to ICT services.</li>
          <li>Q69b and Q74b asks to explain how the percentage of fully conformant web pages was estimated.</li>
          <li>Q79a-d asks for a deeper dive into the enterprise wide virtual meeting platform.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Additional answer choices have been added to:
        <ul>
          <li>Q8 due to WCAG 2.2 release.</li>
          <li>Q11, Q27, and Q28 based on FY23 “Other” inputs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Answer choices have been significantly revised for the following criteria:
      <ul>
        <li>Q30-33</li>
        <li>Q36 (specifically answer choice d)</li>
        <li>Q39-42</li>
        <li>Q53-57</li>
        <li>Q60</li>
        <li>Q62-63</li>
        <li>Q65</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Q68 a-d and Q73 a-d have been moved to a subset of questions to ensure respondents understand that we are looking for a total amount.</li>
      <li>Q71, Q76, Q77, and Q78 are no longer asking for the number of defects by WCAG or Section 508 requirement. Instead, respondents will select which WCAG or Section 508 requirements fail.</li>
      <li>Q51 was moved from the General Information dimension to the Testing and Validation dimension.</li>
      <li>Q66 was moved from the Testing and Validation dimension to the Training dimension.</li>
      <li>To broaden the scope of inquiries regarding ICT, we have introduced 10 new questions from Q80 to Q89, replacing the previous FY23 criteria for Q82-85 and Q87-92. These questions will be rotated on a biennial basis. Anticipate the reintroduction of FY23 criteria for FY25, providing reporting entities time to address identified issues, with the aim of achieving higher conformance by FY25. Additionally, we have revised the answer options in this section. Instead of a simple binary choice regarding Section 508 conformance, respondents are now presented with a scale of conformance, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the extent of defects.</li>
      <li>Q103 has been modified to ask specific questions for the entities to respond to. It remains a free form text field.</li>
      <li>Five questions have been removed altogether: one from Training, one from Content Creation, one from Policies, Procedures, and Practices,  a question in Conformance Metrics regarding a public feedback mechanism, and the criteria regarding defects for enterprise-wide printers due to because of duplicative data, incorrectly scoped questions, or poor data.</li>
    </ul>

  id: 202
  h: Submitting Data
  q: Who will send the Assessment link to the reporting tool?
  a: |
    Registered POCs will receive on or about June 1 an email from “Office of Government-wide Policy” with instructions to access the tool. If you do not receive this email, check your email’s junk folder. 
    
    NOTE: Since the email is sent from a collection tool, the email sender may appear as “surveys@research.gsa.gov.”

  id: 203
  h: Submitting Data
  q: I do not have a link to submit data for my reporting entity. How do I get one?
  a: |
    Please reach out to the General Services Administration’s (GSA) Government-wide IT Accessibility team at <a href="mailto:section.508@gsa.gov">Section.508@gsa.gov</a> to verify the point of contact (POC) for your reporting entity and resolve access issues.
-  
  id: 204
  h: Submitting Data
  q: Will reporting entities be able to send segments of questions to appropriate reporting entity responders or will there be online capability to assign certain questions to reporting entity stakeholders for completion?
  a: |
    No, the reporting tool will not have the functionality to portion out different sections of questions for other individuals to submit responses. Each reporting entity should coordinate information gathering outside of the response tool for the reporting entity POC to submit on behalf of their reporting entity. Parent agencies should coordinate reporting entities to enhance the accuracy and consistency of responses.
-  
  id: 205
  h: Submitting Data
  q: What is the final date for submitting my reporting entity’s answers?
  a: |
    The reporting tool will close on July 31, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. EST. No responses can be submitted or altered after that date.

  id: 206
  h: Submitting Data
  q: Will I be able to edit my reporting entity’s data up until the deadline of July 31, 2024, even if I have submitted the data before the deadline?
  a: |
    Your reporting entity responses cannot be edited after submission without manual steps to unlock your response. If edits are necessary after submission, email GSA’s Government-wide IT Accessibility Program at <a href="mailto:section.508@gsa.gov">Section.508@gsa.gov</a>. Edits or submissions will not be permitted after the submission period closes on July 31, 2024. **NOTE:** Unlocking your reporting entity’s responses may not be immediate. Please carefully review your answers prior to submission to avoid any additional delay.
-  
  id: 207
  h: Submitting Data
  q: What is the best way to navigate the reporting tool?
  a: |
    We recommend gathering all responses prior to accessing and entering data into the reporting tool. This will ease your reporting entity’s ability to start at the beginning of the reporting tool and answer questions in order. We encourage reporting entities to use the <a href="https://assets.section508.gov/assets/files/assessment/2024/FY-24%20Government-wide%20Section%20508%20Assessment%20Criteria.xlsx" target="_blank" class="usa-link--external">Assessment spreadsheet (XLSX)</a> to gather responses.
    
    Within this submission response tool, your data is saved automatically—provided you use the same device and same browser—and you may return to the submission tool to continue entering information as many times as you need. You may navigate to different sections of the Assessment Criteria using the Table of Contents, Previous button or Next button. However, once you enter a section, you must answer all required criteria on the screen before moving to another section using the Table of Contents. You can use the Previous button to navigate backwards without answering all required questions on screen, but you cannot use the "Next" button within a section to skip questions without inputting an answer.

  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: What do I input or select if I don't know an answer?
  a: |
    If a reporting entity is unable to provide the requested information because it is currently unavailable, the reporting entity should select “Unknown” or “N/A.” In rare instances, you may need to input “0” into a text field. Reporting entities will have opportunities to collect any unavailable information during future Assessments.
-  
  id: 302
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: What if I don't have 10 web pages, 10 documents or 5 videos to test?
  a: |
    If your reporting entity does not have 10 web pages (intranet or internet), 10 electronic documents or 5 videos, please test the number of web pages, documents, or videos you do have and report on those. 
-  
  id: 303
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: Can my reporting entity rely solely on a vendor's Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) to determine whether our product is fully accessible for this year's Assessment? 
  a: |
    Yes, you may use an ACR to report whether the ICT product(s) fully conforms to all applicable Section 508 standards.
-  
  id: 304
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: If an ACR or Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) states that a Success Criteria or Section 508 Standard “partially supports,” how should reporting entities use this data to inform a response?
  a: |
    “Partially supports” denotes there is at least one component of the ICT product that fails that criterion. Thus, the ICT does not fully conform to applicable Section 508 requirements. Report “no” for any question that asks if that ICT is fully conformant.
-  
  id: 305
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: As a department or agency with components, what information should I report on?
  a: |
    Agency components and reporting entities, such as bureaus, sub-agencies, or major organizational divisions as determined by the agency, must be reported independently of their “parent” agency. “Parent” agencies must limit reporting to that of the parent agency and not include reporting from component reporting entities.
-  
  id: 306
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: How should reporting entities respond if they use processes, policies, or procedures implemented by their parent agency?
  a: |
   It is acceptable for a reporting entity to utilize parent agency processes, policies, and or services, and each reporting entity should answer appropriately for how they utilize or implement the parent agency process, policy, or service. For example, it is acceptable to answer that a reporting entity has a complaint process even if that reporting entity relies on the complaint process of the parent agency.
   
   Where a reporting entity reports specific data for questions such as FTEs and budget, a reporting entity should not report their parent agency budget and resources but instead give an honest report of their specific reporting entity. Reporting entity specific data should also be reported for Conformance Metrics and most of the General Information questions. Reporting entities should submit their own data without duplication of the parent agency when answering specific outcome-related questions.  
-  
  id: 307
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: How do I estimate Full Time Equivalents (FTEs)?
  a: |
    When reporting the total number of FTEs your reporting entity has in its Section 508 Program office or equivalent, include the FTEs of individuals who directly support the activities of the Section 508 Program office or equivalent. Exclude individuals responsible for accessibility as a matter of practice within their regular duties in other organizational business units.
    
    When it is not possible to ascertain the number of employee or contractor hours dedicated to the reporting entity Section 508 Program office or equivalent, please estimate. First, determine the percentage of Section 508 work performed on the contract. Then, apply this percentage to the total cost of the contract. Finally, divide that dollar value by the average cost of each FTE.
-  
  id: 308
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: How do I determine frequency of activities?
  a: |
    <ol>
      <li>Never: 0%.</li>
      <li>Sometimes: Activities that are performed approximately 1% to 24% of the time.</li>
      <li>Regularly: Activities that are performed approximately 25% to 59% of the time.</li>
      <li>Frequently: Activities that are performed approximately 60% to 89% of the time.</li>
      <li>Almost always: Activities that are performed approximately 90% or more of the time.</li>
    </ol>

    NOTE: The scale of frequency is not an evenly distributed linear scale.
    
    A specific range is provided for each response, such as “25% to 59%.” It is not expected that your reporting entity tracks the exact percentage for every item asked about; for example,  “Yes, my reporting entity does XYZ 59.75% of the time, so that’s ‘Frequently.’” Your reporting entity can arrive at an estimate based on your collective experience; for example,  “Yes, my reporting entity does XYZ more than half the time, and maybe even a bit more than half of the time. I think this is something my reporting entity does ‘Frequently.’”

  id: 309
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: Subjectivity and Interpretation
  a: |
    Many of the question responses contain multiple items that may be difficult to assess as individual elements. For example, one of the responses for Question 60 is:
    
    “d) Frequently verified prior to acceptance, including required remediation when necessary (approximately 60%-89% of the time).”

    There are two parts to this response option: verification and remediation. Are both items done “Frequently?” Is verification “frequent” and remediation “almost always?” There may be cases where there is not an exact answer, but please provide your reporting entity’s best estimation of what happens in practice.
-  
  id: 310
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: Reporting Entity Goals Versus Practice
  a: |
    Please select the most appropriate response for what happens in practice at your reporting entity. For example, one of the responses for Question 50 is:
    
    “c) Regularly (approximately 25%-59% of the time).”
    
    If it is true your reporting entity includes this requirement in formal policy but in practice web content testers sometimes follow the required test process, please select the response that aligns with your reporting entity practice rather than the requirement. In this situation, your reporting entity’s response will be “b) Sometimes” rather than “c) Regularly” because the former more accurately reflects day-to-day activities.
-  
  id: 311
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: What answer should I select if my reporting entity is in between two options, such as a and b?
  a: |
    Select the response that is most representative of your reporting entity’s current status in that activity or business function.
-  
  id: 312
  h: Interpreting Criteria
  q: Will I be able to write open-ended explanations to answer selections?
  a: |
    Yes. At the end of the survey, there will be an open-ended question (see Question 103) where you may write any additional details about your program, answer selections, etc. Please use this form field to provide additional narrative you think is relevant. When referencing a specific question, please note the Dimension, such as  Conformance Metrics, and the question number, such as Question 70.

  h: Point of Contact Information
  q: Can one POC submit responses for multiple components within the agency?
  a: |
    Yes. The same POC can register for multiple reporting entities, but each entity will have its own specific link to the online response tool. The designated POC will need to ensure the correct link is used to report entity-specific responses.
-  
  id: 406
  h: Point of Contact Information
  q: Can more than one individual register as the reporting entity POC and have access to the response tool?
  a: |
    Please limit registration to one POC per reporting entity. Once your reporting entity POC has submitted their information in the POC registration tool, they will receive a unique link for the reporting entity report submission. Once the response tool link is opened, the tool will lock to that specific user. To unlock the response tool for a different user, you must contact GSA at <a href="mailto:section.508@gsa.gov">Section.508@gsa.gov</a> for a manual unlock.
