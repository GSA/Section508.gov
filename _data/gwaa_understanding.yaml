    Do not include contractors in this response.

    Include only the federal employees **working directly** on your agency's 508 program (e.g., there is formal designation to support the Section 508 program or equivalent). 

    If, over the course of the reporting period, your agency added federal staff or had a reduction in federal staff, report an average of federal FTEs.

    For example, if your agency has:
    - A Section 508 Program Manager who is Full Time = 1 FTE for the 508 Program.
    - An administrative assistant who works 50-50 in both Section 508 and Section 504 areas = 0.5 FTE for the 508 Program.
    - An employee who works one day a week on Section 508 training for the 508 Program, and the rest of the week on other training for the agency = 0.2 FTE for the 508 program.

    Include the salary plus benefits for the number of federal FTEs (provided in Question 1) that support your agency’s Section 508 Program **plus** all other spending allocated to your agency’s Section 508 Program (e.g., contractor support, licensing, remediation services, tools, etc.)

    If your agency is not sure how to estimate the salary plus benefits for each federal FTE, use the grade salary below that best align with each of your agency's federal FTEs. Then, add each FTE staff salary and all other Section 508 program allocated spending to determine your agency’s estimated Section 508 program budget. 

    **NOTE:** The salaries listed below are the Washington, DC metro area locality pay rates for Grades 1-15, Step 1 multiplied by 1.31 to estimate the salary plus benefits (rounded up to the nearest dollar). If estimating, use these numbers even if the federal FTE is not located in the DC metro area.

    - Grade 1: $34,757
    - Grade 2: $39.083
    - Grade 3: $42,643
    - Grade 4: $47,870

    - Grade 13: $139,938
    - Grade 14: $165,365
    - Grade 15: $194,514

    For example: Your agency Section 508 Program has 2 FTEs (one at Grade 12 and one at Grade 14) and an additional $500,000 for contractor support and accessibility tools. $117,683 + $165,365+ $500,000= $783,048. Round to nearest thousand and report $783,000.

          <p>If not all your ICT acquisitions considered the needs of users with disabilities, then select this item and any other items in this list as appropriate.</p>
          <p>If any acquisitions or developments used heuristic analysis (i.e., general design principles) of user needs, or other informal methods, select this item.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Disabilities are included in customer/user personas:
          <p>Like using heuristics, personas are used to hypothesize a set of user requirements based on general design principles and expert experience. This is not user testing, and it is not user consultation, but it is a way to consider the needs of end-users during acquisition and/or development projects.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Individuals with disabilities are consulted when defining customer/user needs:
          <p>This refers to direct consultation with end-users, either face-to-face, via phone or video conferencing. Direct consultation can involve interviewing end users, observing end users during tasks, holding focus groups with representative samples of end-users, and other methods.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Individuals with disabilities are consulted in development of Section 508 conformance validation testing processes:
          <p>If you are developing (and/or refining) your test processes, select this answer if the development process involves active consultation of individuals with disabilities (i.e., using the same kind of methods as in c, above). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Individuals with disabilities are directly involved in Section 508 conformance validation testing:
          <p>If your agency's testing team includes individuals with disabilities, select this item. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Individuals with disabilities are directly involved in user acceptance testing:
          <p>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) refers to implementation in a real-world setting. This might be part of a phased implementation of a prototype to be used in actual day to day business of the agency. If end-users with disabilities are involved with using the product or system as part of a UAT process, select this item.</p>

    User testing may include users internal and/or external to your agency. 

    **NOTE**: See also Understanding for Question 6.

    ----------------------

    The following applies broadly to this question and to several other questions that employ the same frequency scale:

    **Frequency**  

    - Never: 0%
    - Sometimes/Some: Activities that are performed approximately 1%-24% of the time.
    - Regularly: Activities that are performed approximately 25%-59% of the time.
    - Frequently: Activities that are performed approximately 60%-89% of the time.
    - Almost always: Activities that are performed approximately 90% or more of the time.

    **NOTE** that the scale of frequency is not an evenly distributed linear scale.

    A specific range is provided for each response (e.g., "25% to 59%"); it is not expected that your agency tracks the exact percentage for every item in the assessment (e.g., "Yes, my agency does XYZ 59.75% of the time, so that's 'Frequently'"). Your agency can make an estimate based on your agency's collective experience (e.g., "Yes, my agency does XYZ more than half the time – maybe even a bit more than half of the time. I think this is something my agency does 'Frequently'").

    **Subjectivity and Interpretation**

    Many of the question responses contain multiple items which may be difficult to assess as individual elements. For example, one of the responses for Question 55 is:

    "d) Contract deliverables that are required to be Section 508 conformant are frequently verified prior to acceptance, including required remediation when necessary."

    There are two parts to this response option: verification, and remediation. Are both items done 'Frequently'? Is verification 'frequent' and remediation is 'almost always'? There may be cases where there is not an exact answer, but please provide your agency’s best estimation of what happens in practice.

    **Agency Goals versus Practice**

    Please select the most appropriate response for what happens in practice at your agency. For example, one of the responses for Question 46 is:

    "c) Agency requires a standard Section 508 conformance validation test process in formal policy and web content testers regularly follow the required test process.”

    If it is true that your agency includes this requirement in formal policy, but in actual practice web content testers sometimes follow the required test process, please select the response that aligns with your agency practice rather than the requirement. In this situation, your agency response will be b) (Sometimes) rather than c) (Regularly) because the former more accurately reflects day to day activities.

    A delay of one month or longer is considered "significant".

    While an explanation for answering "No" is not required, please be encouraged to note if, within the reporting period:
    - an intern, detailee or new hire who uses assistive technology had no delays due to ICT interoperability, or
    -  your agency had no new hires, detailees or interns, or
    - your agency had no new hires, detailees or interns who requested assistive technology.  

    Below are two examples of scenarios where a significant delay was caused by lack of ICT interoperability with assistive technology:
    - A project team regularly references a knowledge repository that has known accessibility issues, but it is used anyway because no current team members have a disability.  The agency realizes that a detailee slated to join the team would be unable to perform their work duties due to the inaccessible repository. The agency decides to significantly delay the detailee's start date until the accessibility issues in the repository are remediated. 
    - A summer internship program where the protocol is to provide interns government furnished (GFE) laptops. A fully qualified intern makes a timely request for the JAWS screen-reader to be installed on their government furnished laptop.  Due to lack of interoperability, this intern is not able to get JAWS working until 35 days after her peers have begun work, because a non-standard GFE laptop configuration must be approved and ordered to support her assistive technology.

    For example, your agency 508 Program Manager requests and receives the following resources to support the agency Section 508 program:
    - time allocated for all Section 508 team staff to take relevant Section 508 training, 
    - attendance to a bootcamp for accessible coding, 
    - trainer led training on the agency-specific content management system for the Section 508 PM, 
    - support and resources for automated testing tools approval and installation for enterprise use, 
    - multiple vendor demonstrations of accessibility and assistive technology tools, and

    Estimate how many individual pages are public facing: 
    - A web application may work on a single web page (single URL) but have multiple tabs and sections with dynamically generated content depending on the user's tasks (this counts as one web page).
    - A single web page may be automatically rendered one way for a PC browser, and another way for a Tablet/Mobile Device (this counts as one web page).

    The reported number should be your agency’s estimation based on available data sources. Sources include:
    - Your agency's web team,
    - The analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) and/or Website Dashboard that your agency uses,
    - Use public Google index count. Navigate to Google and type [your agency].gov or [your agency].mil. For example, Google search “GSA.gov”. Below the search bar and above the linked results will be a total count of sites Google found. GSA.gov returned “About 86,000,000 results”.

    **NOTE:** When seeking the above information from your agency’s web team, your agency point of contact (POC) will also need certain information on the most frequently used digital content elements of your agency website, as required by Questions 79, 80, and 81.

    For a web page to be [Section 508 conformant](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionS), the entire page must meet all applicable Section 508 technical requirements. For web, this is, at a minimum, WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria.

    **To be able to report accurate data for this question, each page must be fully tested; manual testing is necessary** (but may be used alongside automated tools).
    
    If your agency has only tested the required 10 web pages in Question 79, please provide metrics here for only those pages. If your agency tested additional pages within the reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023), use (combine) both data sets to report conformance metrics for your agency’s internet sites.

    **NOTE:** Web-based applications with dynamic content or customizable views within a single page should be counted as one page. 

    Follow the formula below to report the total percentage of web pages that are fully conformant:
    1. Determine whether each web page tested “passes” or “fails” Section 508 conformance.
      - “Pass” means that the web page meets all applicable Section 508 technical requirements.
    2. Total Percentage = [total number of passing web pages divided by the total number of web pages tested] x 100%.
    3. For example: 20 web pages are tested. 13 web pages are found to be fully conformant. 7 web pages have one or more Section 508 defects present. 13/20 = .65 x 100 = 65% of web pages fully conform to Section 508 standards. Round to the nearest whole number when necessary.

If your agency tested additional pages within the reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023), use (combine) both data sets to report conformance metrics for your agency’s internet sites.

    Below is an example of how to calculate the average number of Section 508 non-conformance issues per page:

    1. Determine how many web pages were evaluated in the reporting period. 
    2.Review agency test reports (manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both manual and automated testing) and count how many non-conformance issues were found for each page tested. 
      -  Additional testing is not needed to answer this question; use the test reports your agency has available to provide data for this question. 
    3. Average number of non-conformance issues per page = Total number of all non-conformance issues found divided  by the total number of pages
    4. For example: 20 web pages are tested. The defects found per page are: 45, 75, 80, 12, 30, 48, 53, 90, 5, 16, 20, 22, 4, 8, 16, 11, 21, 13, 9, 0 = 578. 578/20 = 28.9. Round to the nearest whole number and report 29.

    **NOTE:** The sum of responses to Questions 66, 67 and 68 should equal the total number given in Question 63’s response.

     **NOTE:** Please include [extranet](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionE) web pages when answering this question.

    Estimate how many individual pages only an internal user to your agency  could access: 
    - A web application may work on a single web page (single URL), but have multiple tabs and sections with dynamically generated content depending on the user's tasks (this counts as one web page),
    - A single web page may be automatically rendered one way for a PC browser, and another way for a Tablet/Mobile Device (this counts as one web page).

    This estimated page number can be your agency’s estimation based on available data sources. Sources include:
    -  Your agency's web team,
    - The analytics your agency uses.

    Only estimate the number of unique web pages that were tested for accessibility manually, with an automated tool, and/or both manually and with an automated tool during the current reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023).

    If, during this reporting period, your agency only tested the required digital content elements in Question 78  for this assessment, answer "10” web pages for this question. 

    If, during this reporting period your agency tested additional pages, then your agency’s answer should include the 10 required plus the additional number your agency tested as part of your agency’s regular program.

    **NOTE:** If a web application appears on a single web page (single URL), count it as one web page.

    For a web page to be [Section 508 conformant](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionS), the entire page must meet all applicable Section 508 technical requirements. For web, this is, at a minimum, WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria.

    **To be able to report accurate data for this question, each page must be fully tested; manual testing is necessary** (but may be used alongside automated tools).
    
    If your agency has only tested the required 10 web pages in Question 78, please provide metrics here for only those pages. If your agency tested additional pages within the reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023), use (combine) both data sets to report conformance metrics for your agency’s internet sites.

    **NOTE:** Web-based applications with dynamic content or customizable views within a single page should be counted as one page. 

    Follow the formula below to report the total percentage of web pages that are fully conformant:
    1. Determine whether each web page tested “passes” or “fails” Section 508 conformance.
        - “Pass” means that the web page meets all applicable Section 508 technical requirements.
    2. Total Percentage = [total number of passing web pages divided by the total number of web pages tested] x 100%.
    3.  Example: 20 web pages are tested. 13 web pages are found to be fully conformant. 7 web pages have one or more Section 508 defects present. 13/20 = .65 x 100 = 65% of web pages fully conform to Section 508 standards. Round to the nearest whole number when necessary.

    If your agency only tested the required 10 web pages in Question 78, please provide metrics here for only those pages. If your agency tested additional pages within the reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023), use (combine) both data sets to report conformance metrics for your agency’s internet sites.

    Below is an example of how to calculate the average number of Section 508 non-conformance issues per page:

    1. Determine how many web pages were evaluated in the reporting period. 
    2. Review agency test reports (manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both manual and automated testing) and count how many non-conformance issues were found for each page tested. 
        - Additional testing is not needed to answer this question; use the test reports your agency has available to provide data for this question. 
    3. Average number of non-conformance issues per page= [total number of all non-conformance issues found divided by the total number of pages].
    4. For example: 20 web pages are tested. The defects found per page are: 45, 75, 80, 12, 30, 48, 53, 90, 5, 16, 20, 22, 4, 8, 16, 11, 21, 13, 9, 0 = 578. 578/20 = 28.9. Round to the nearest whole number and report 29.

    Verify that your agency has an accessibility statement published. This may be a link (e.g., in your agency’s website footer) to an accessibility statement on the domain website. The statement may be its own page or within a page which contains several website policies.

    For example: "The General Services Administration is committed to providing access to our websites for all visitors with disabilities. Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide individuals with disabilities access to electronic and information technology and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency…"

    To find out which of your agency's **internal intranet** web pages count as "Top viewed", use the same approach as in the Supplemental Guidance for Question 70. **Your agency should identify the top 10 viewed web pages within the entire reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023).** 

    **Testing each web page for full conformance to Section 508 will require comprehensive manual testing.** Please fully test each web page and report the number of failures found by web page for each Section 508 Standard/WCAG Success Criterion. 

    If your agency does not have any intranet pages, please select N/A. If your agency has less than 10 intranet pages, test all possible pages and report results. If your agency has intranet pages but does not have resources to test, please select “Unavailable.”

    **NOTE:** Web-based applications with dynamic content or customizable views within a single page should be counted as one page.

    If your agency tests web pages using automated tools only [See Question 73], your agency must switch to a different method to respond to this assessment criteria. Your agency must instead use a manual test process [See Question 74], or a combined manual and automated test process [See Question 75].

    Please report the total number of each type of Success Criteria/Section 508 standard failure found on the 10 web pages. For example, if on your agency’s Benefits page, there are 16 instances of missing alternative text on the page, report “16” for 1.1.1 Non-text Content. On the second page, there are no instances of failures for 1.1.1 Non-text Content; report zero. 

    If a given Success Criteria does not apply to the page tested, report zero.

    Your agency’s feedback/complaint process may only include providing a phone number and/or email address as the method to submit feedback or a complaint. If this content is provided digitally (e.g., on a web page, email signature, etc.), the entire user path to reach that information to access/activate the phone/email address should fully conform to all applicable Section 508 standards.

    Your agency’s 508 Program Office should be one of the primary points of contact for 508-related formal [complaints](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionC), but complaints may be handled in collaboration with or primarily by other departments. Your agency may need to contact other department(s) that handle such complaints, such as your parent agency, Human Resources, Civil Rights Office, or the points of contact for the Section 504 Office.

    **NOTE:** [Complaints](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionC) differ from [public feedback responses](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionP) that your agency receives [See Question 99].

    Your agency response should include only those formal [complaints](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionC) which have reached their conclusion (i.e., have a "closed" status through successful resolution, or adjudication, or otherwise have a "closed" status). Do not include complaints which remain in process, unresolved, ongoing, or any similar status.

    **NOTE:** The number of complaints [Question 95] minus the number of closed complaints reported here [Question 97] should equal the number of open complaints within the reporting period (June 1, 2022 through May 31, 2023).

    Each solicitation must include all applicable language requiring the ICT to be conformant to Section 508 requirements.

    To find your agency’s recent ICT-related solicitations:
    - Seek out the assistance of those in your agency responsible for ICT procurement,
    - Find your agency’s most recent solicitations where they are posted online (e.g., the System for Award Management (SAM.gov); the GSA eBuy site),
    - Review the [GSA Solicitation Review Tool (SRT)](https://www.section508.gov/buy/solicitation-review-tool/) results (if your agency uses the SRT).

    **NOTE:** Refer to the definition of [ICT (Information and Communication Technology)](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/definition-of-terms/#sectionI) for the scope of software and services covered by this question.

    Consider all agency web content when answering this question (e.g., internally developed or procured). The expectation is not that agencies thoroughly review every ACR and/or accessibility test report within the reporting period to find this information; this may be an agency estimation of common non-conformance issues identified in test accessibility reports/ACRs within the reporting period.

    This information will help provide a sense of the common non-conformance issues across agencies and help tailor recommendations back to agencies and/or Congress.
