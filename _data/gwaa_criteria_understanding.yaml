    While an explanation for answering "No" is not required, feel free to note if:

    - The reporting entity had no new hires, detailees, or interns, or
    
    - The reporting entity had no new hires, detailees, or interns who requested assistive technology.

    Below are two examples of scenarios where a significant delay was caused by the lack of ICT interoperability with assistive technology:
    
    - A project team regularly references a knowledge repository that has known accessibility issues, but it is used anyway because no current team members have a disability. The reporting entity realizes a detailee slated to join the team would be unable to perform his work duties due to the inaccessible repository. The reporting entity decides to delay the detailee's start date for 75 days until the accessibility issues in the repository are remediated.
    
    - A summer internship program where the protocol is to provide interns with government-furnished (GFE) laptops. A fully qualified intern makes a timely request for the JAWS screen reader to be installed on her GFE laptop. Due to a lack of interoperability, this intern is not able to get JAWS working until 35 calendar days after her peers have begun work because a non-standard GFE laptop configuration must be approved and ordered to support her assistive technology.

    For a web page to be Section 508 conformant (see the definition of <a href="../definition-of-terms/#section-508-conformant" target="_blank">Section 508 conformant</a>), the entire page must meet all applicable Section 508 technical requirements. For web, this is WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria, at a minimum.

    To be able to report accurate data for this question, each page must be fully tested; manual testing is necessary but may be used alongside automated tools. If the reporting entity cannot answer this question due to a reliance on only automated tools, select "Unknown" or a sampling methodology may be used. 

    Sampling may be used to estimate a percentage. To determine an appropriate number of web pages to sample, you can use a free, web-based sample size calculator that accepts confidence level, margin of error, and population size. Enter search terms such as "sample size calculator" to find a suitable tool. Consider a 90% confidence level and 10% margin of error. 

    NOTE: For population size, enter the same value you previously determined for Question 67 as the total number of public internet web pages.

    If the reporting entity has only tested the required 10 web pages in Question 71, please provide metrics here for only those pages. If additional pages were tested within the reporting period, combine both data sets to report conformance metrics for the reporting entity's internet sites.

    **NOTE:** Web-based applications with dynamic content or customizable views within a single page should be counted as one page. 

    Below is an example of how to calculate the average number of Section 508 non-conformance issues per page:

    1. Determine how many web pages were evaluated in the reporting period. 
    2. Review test reports (manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both manual and automated testing) and count how many non-conformance issues were found for each page tested. 
      - Additional testing is not needed to answer this question; use the test reports your reporting entity has available to provide data for this question. 
    3. Average number of non-conformance issues per page = Total number of all non-conformance issues found divided by the total number of pages
    4. For example: 20 web pages are tested. The defects found per page are: 45, 75, 80, 12, 30, 48, 53, 90, 5, 16, 20, 22, 4, 8, 16, 11, 21, 13, 9, 0 = 578. 578/20 = 28.9. Round to the nearest whole number and report 29.

    **NOTE:** Web-based applications with dynamic content or customizable views within a single page should be counted as one page.

    If the reporting entity tests web pages using automated tools only, they must switch to a different method to respond to this assessment. The reporting entity must use a manual test process or a combined manual and automated test process.

    When reporting failures, please select each Success Criterion or Section 508 standard with any failure found on the web page. For example, if on the reporting entity Home page, there are 8 instances of missing alternative text on the page, check 1.1.1 Non-text Content. On the second page, there are no instances of failures for 1.1.1 Non-text Content; leave 1.1.1 unchecked.

If the reporting entity has electronic documents but does not have resources to test, please select “Unavailable.”

    Do not pull the document from an internal repository; download the document directly from the site and test that version. This ensures the reporting entity is testing the same version end users of the site are accessing.

    When reporting failures, please select each Success Criterion or Section 508 standard with any failure found in the document. For example, if on a Factsheet, there are eight instances of missing alternative text on the page, check 1.1.1 Non-text Content. On the second document, there are no instances of failures for 1.1.1 Non-text Content; leave 1.1.1 unchecked. 

    If a given standard or criterion does not apply to the document tested, leave it unchecked.

  u-descr: | 
    The final layout in the tool will be forthcoming. For FY24, we will ask you to select which Section 508 standard or WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criterion fail in addition to the video name and URL. 

    To find out which of the reporting entity's public and internal videos count as "Top viewed," use the same approach as in Understanding for Question 67 and 72. The reporting entity should identify the top 5 viewed videos within the entire reporting period. Include videos hosted on other sites such as YouTube.

    Testing each video for full conformance to Section 508 will require comprehensive manual testing. Please fully test each video and report which  Section 508 Standard or WCAG Success Criterion has at least one defect. 

    If the reporting entity does not produce or host any videos, please select N/A. If the reporting entity has less than five public and internal videos, test all possible videos and report results. If the reporting entity has videos but does not have resources to test, please select “Unavailable.”

    When reporting failures, please select each Success Criterion or Section 508 standard with any failure found in the video. For example, if in an About Us video, there are 10 instances of inaccurate captions, check 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded). In the second video, there are no instances of failures for 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded); leave 1.2.2 unchecked. 

    If a given standard or criterion does not apply to the video tested, leave it unchecked.

      <li>Unknown</li>
      <li>N/A- reporting entity does not have any reservation system</li>
    </ol>
  u-descr: | 
    This question is specifically asking about the system used within the reporting entity to reserve meeting rooms or workspaces. The reservation system in question should be the centralized system that organizes and streamlines the process of reserving rooms and space within the reporting entity. This may be through a web reservation site or application. One example is BookIt. If the reporting entity has more than one reservation system used enterprise-wide, select the most widely used to answer this question. 

    To estimate a percentage of conformance, follow the formula and steps below:

    Percentage of conformance =[(Standards and Criteria that Pass or Do Not Apply) / (Total Number of Applicable Standards and Criteria )] x 100

    1. Determine how many Section 508 standards or WCAG 2.0 AA criteria apply to the ICT:
      - For web content, there are 41 requirements (38 WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria and three Section 508 provisions related to media players).
      - For software, there are 57 requirements (34 WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria (using E207.2.1 Word Substitution when Applying WCAG to Non-Web Software) and 23 Section 508 provisions).
      - For hardware, there are 61 Section 508 provisions.
      - For electronic documents, there are 34 WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria (using E205.4.1 Word Substitution when Applying WCAG to Non-Web Documents). 
    2. Determine how many Section 508 standards or WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria Pass or Do Not Apply. Alternatively, you may decide to subtract the number of standards that fail or were Not Tested from the number of applicable standards in Step 1.
    3. Divide the number of applicable requirements (in Step 1) by the number of Section 508 requirements that pass or do not apply (in Step 2). 
    4. Multiply the answer in Step 4 by 100 to get the percentage. Round to the nearest whole number and select the most appropriate answer choice. 

    For example, your reservation system is a web page and you determine all web requirements apply for a total of 41 applicable Section 508 requirements. According to the test report, 10 WCAG 2.0 AA criteria fail and 31 requirements pass. Next, divide the number of applicable requirements by the number of Section 508 requirements that pass (31/41= 0.756) and then multiply the answer by 100 to get your percentage = 75.6%. Round to the nearest whole number and select "c) Conforms to 50% - 90% of applicable Section 508 requirements."

    The Congressional Justification is an annual budget request. If the reporting entity's parent agency hosts the published Congressional justification that includes the reporting entity, please coordinate testing of this content with your parent agency and report the same data as the parent agency for this question. 

    To estimate a percentage of conformance, follow the formula and steps below:

    Percentage of conformance = [(Standards and Criteria that Pass or Do Not Apply) / (Total Number of Applicable Standards and Criteria)] x 100

    1. Determine how many Section 508 standards or WCAG 2.0 AA criteria apply to the ICT:
      - For web content, there are 41 requirements (38 WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria and three Section 508 provisions related to media players).
      - For electronic documents, there are 34 WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria (using E205.4.1 Word Substitution when Applying WCAG to Non-Web Documents). 
    2. Determine how many Section 508 standards or WCAG 2.0 AA Success Criteria Pass or Do Not Apply. Alternatively, you may decide to subtract the number of standards that fail or were Not Tested from the number of applicable standards in Step 1.
    3. Divide the number of applicable requirements (in Step 1) by the number of Section 508 requirements that pass or do not apply (in Step 2). 
    4. Multiply the answer in Step 4 by 100 to get the percentage. Round to the nearest whole number and select the most appropriate answer choice.
