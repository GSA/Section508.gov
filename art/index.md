title: Accessibility Requirements Tool
---
The Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART) is a step-by-step guide to help you easily identify relevant accessibility requirements from the Revised 508 Standards, and incorporate them into your procurement and contracting documentation, as well as in-house IT development. GSA’s IT Accessibility Program developed ART as part of its mission to provide technical assistance to federal agencies, to improve compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Use ART to buy and build technology that’s accessible to all.
