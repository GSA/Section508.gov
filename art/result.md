          <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
          <p>
            By including Section 508 requirements in the solicitation, you are ensuring potential Offerors know which Section 508 standards apply to commercially available technology products required to be offered by the vendor in their proposals, as well as requirements to ensure technology services provided will support the agency’s ability to comply with the Section 508 law.
