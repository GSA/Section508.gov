      <p class="text-black"><strong>Did you know that some people are unable to control animations, hear the narration, or see the information within pre-recorded videos played during meetings?</strong></p>
      <p class="text-black">Whether you are presenting to a virtual audience viewing on a computer screen, an in-person meeting using a large display, or movie-size screen—or a mix of somewhere in between—accessible media must be used to avoid possible photosensitive reactions and ensure individuals can understand information conveyed via sound or imagery.</p>
