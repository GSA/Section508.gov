Mrs. Rebecca Lovley serves as the Section 508 Program Manager at the Federal Communications Commission.  She is responsible for ensuring that all Information and Communication Technology (ICT) the FCC procures, maintains, develops, and uses is accessible to employees and members of the public with disabilities and that the information given is comparable to the access available to others. In 1998 Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require all Federal Agencies make ICT accessible to people with disabilities. Rebecca is very passionate about her role and feels very lucky to be in a position to help her fellow coworkers and members of the public.
